<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> would be difficult to find a subject of more
universal interest than that of dress, and hosts of
books have been written which deal with the attire
that has been adopted at different times and by
various nations or social classes. The ornamental and
artistic sides of the question have also received much
consideration, but the volumes that have appeared
serve chiefly as works of reference. The present book
aims at being of more immediate interest and usefulness;
it starts with things as they are, and is really a
popular contribution to the natural history of man.</p>

<p>On all sides the advantages of observation and the
need for the nature-study method in education are
being rightly urged, but there is a tendency to narrow
the purview. Anything in our environment is worthy
of notice, and though attention is well directed towards
that which is least artificial, we should not
leave man and his works altogether on one side.
There is material for observation, research, and deduction,
even in a bowler hat and a cut-away coat.</p>

<p>One of the pleasantest features in connection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
the making of this book has been the kind and ready
help which I have received from all sides. Here and
there throughout the text the names of friends and
correspondents who have given their assistance have
been mentioned. To these I offer my hearty thanks,
as well as to the following, who with suggestions,
information, or with material for illustrations, have
contributed in no small way to the interest of the
book: Messrs. Fownes Brothers &amp; Company, Mr.
Allan A. Hooke, Mr. W.&nbsp;S. Ward, Mr. Karl, of
Messrs. Nathan &amp; Company, Messrs. Tress &amp; Company,
Messrs. Lincoln &amp; Bennett, Mr. M.&nbsp;D. Hill,
the Rev. A.&nbsp;W. Upcott, Head Master of Christ&rsquo;s
Hospital, Miss Clark, Miss Hodgson, the Rev. R.
Ashington Bullen, Mr. Henry Miller, of the Church
Association, Mr. Ravenscroft, of Messrs. Ede Sons
&amp; Ravenscroft, Mr. Paley Baildon, Mr. George
Hertslet, of the Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s Office, Messrs.
Wilkinson &amp; Company, Mr. C.&nbsp;M. MÃ¼hlberg, Mr.
W.&nbsp;S. Parker, of Messrs. Debenhams, Ltd., Capt.
H. Trench, Major J.&nbsp;W. Mallet, of the <cite>Army and
Navy Gazette</cite>, Mr. Basil White, of Messrs. Hawkes
&amp; Company, Mr. W.&nbsp;H. Jesson, Messrs. Souter
&amp; Company, Mr. William Lawrence, Mr. Heather
Bigg, Dr. J. Cantlie, and the Rt. Hon. Viscountess
Harberton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>A glance at the bibliography, which is given on
pages <a href="#Page_363">363</a>-<a href="#Page_367">7</a>, will show the principal books and
papers to which reference has been made.</p>

<p>In connection with the illustrations, special thanks
must be given to Monsieur Maurice Sand, the Editor
of the <cite>Review of the University of Brussels</cite>, for his
kind permission to reproduce a number of the figures
used to illustrate a translation of Sir George Darwin&rsquo;s
article. These are Figures <a href="#fig014">14</a>, <a href="#fig017">17</a>, <a href="#fig018">18</a>, <a href="#fig019">19</a>, <a href="#fig021">21</a>, <a href="#fig022">22</a>, <a href="#fig023">23</a>,
<a href="#fig026">26</a>, <a href="#fig027">27</a>, <a href="#fig030">30</a>, <a href="#fig031">31</a>, <a href="#fig033">33</a>, <a href="#fig046">46</a>, <a href="#fig048">48</a>, <a href="#fig062">62</a>, <a href="#fig063">63</a>, and <a href="#fig082">82</a>. Acknowledgments
are due to Mr. St. John Hope for Figures
<a href="#fig086">86</a>-<a href="#fig088">8</a>, to Messrs. A. &amp; C. Black for Figures <a href="#fig122-123">123</a> and
<a href="#fig124-125">124</a> and <a href="#fig132">132</a> and <a href="#fig133">133</a>, and to Messrs. Prewett &amp; Co.
for Figures <a href="#fig111">111</a> and <a href="#fig112">112</a>.</p>

<p>For the original of Plate <a href="#plate02">II</a>, I am indebted to the
kindness of Captain R. Ford, of Plate <a href="#plate03">III</a> to Mr.
Henry Stevens; Plate <a href="#plate04">IV</a> has been taken from a
brass rubbing in Rugby School Museum, through
the kind offices of Mr. J.&nbsp;M. Hardwich. I have to
thank Mr. R. Bamber for the original of Plate <a href="#plate08">VIII</a>,
which was obtained through his instrumentality.
Figure <span class="f8"><a href="#plate09b">B</a></span> of Plate <a href="#plate09">IX</a> was kindly contributed by the
Rev. A.&nbsp;W. Upcott, Head Master of Christ&rsquo;s Hospital,
and Figures <span class="f8"><a href="#plate10b">B</a></span> and <span class="f8"><a href="#plate10c">C</a></span> on Plate <a href="#plate10">X</a> were copied
from Moseley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Voyage of the &lsquo;Challenger,&rsquo;&rdquo; by
the kind permission of Mr. John Murray, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
Figure <span class="f8"><a href="#plate10d">D</a></span> is due to the courtesy of General Robley.
Plate <a href="#plate11">XI</a> is reprinted from <cite>The Reliquary</cite>, by the
kind permission of Messrs. Bemrose and Sons, and
the source of other illustrations is acknowledged
beneath them, while the classic collection of pictures
which were brought together by the late Mr. F.&nbsp;W.
Fairholt to illustrate his &ldquo;Costume in England&rdquo; has
proved, as will be seen, of the utmost service.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have much pleasure in calling
attention to the time and care which Mr. W.&nbsp;J. Webb
has expended upon the figures, which are a feature
of the book; and I must mention the willing help
which I have been afforded in a number of details by
Miss Amy Astbury and Mr. Bernard Weaver.</p>

THE THRALL OF DRESS</h2>

<p class="srt2">THE PRINCIPLES OF EVOLUTION APPLIED TO CLOTHES</p>

<p class="srt3"><i>The numbers in the text refer to a bibliography at the end
of the book</i></p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Unluckily</span>, perhaps, we are born naked and
helpless, but no sooner do we come into the
world than we are provided with body-guards in the
shape of clothes. In consequence, our social position
is made manifest. Our vanity is flattered at the same
time that our modesty is assured. On the other
hand, however, our skin may be chafed, our hair
worn away, and, should our equipment strictly follow
the dictates of the Goddess Fashion, our bodies
may even be deformed and our lives shortened.
Moreover, there are other penalties to be paid; we
are kept warm in summer as well as in winter, the
purchase of our attire may entail the spending of
much money, while the mere donning and doffing of
our clothes gives rise to a prodigious waste of time.</p>

<p>Even tramps have at intervals to replace the rags
which cover them, and while, for all practical purposes,
every one else takes off his clothes when going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to bed and puts them on again when getting up,
many of those who are at work in the daytime
&ldquo;dress for dinner&rdquo; in the evening. Moreover, Society
may demand a further expenditure of time on the
part of its members, and the rule may be laid down
that the higher the standing of a civilized individual,
the more often does he change his garments. In
fact, more than one monarch, from the way in which
he appears in different uniforms at various functions
which follow one another in quick succession, has
been likened to the now familiar &ldquo;lightning change
artist&rdquo; of the music-hall stage.</p>

<p>It is thus quite clear that all of us are more or less
under the thrall of dress. Those, therefore, who find
the position irksome, will gain solace from the interesting
investigations which can be made into the
origin and development of costume. Others, again,
whose clothes already find favour in their eyes, will
enjoy looking at them from a different point of view.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, our artificial coverings have
become so much a part of our life that one may
perhaps be allowed to apply the methods of the
naturalist to their consideration, and deal with them
as if they were part and parcel of the creature which
wears them.</p>

<p>Darwin established beyond a doubt<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> that the
plants and animals of to-day are the direct descendants
of older and often very different forms, and it is the
task and delight of the naturalist to trace their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
genealogies. Most useful suggestions may be obtained
from the small vestiges that remain in the
bodies of present-day creatures, of structures which
in early times were important and useful organs.</p>

<p>For instance, if the skin be lifted from the head of
a &ldquo;slow worm&rdquo; we find a third eye, which tells us
that once its ancestors, like the giant Cyclops, were
able to look out from the middle of their faces.</p>

<p>Again, to take a case which applies to ourselves,
and has a melancholy interest for us, one might
mention the vermiform appendix. This is a remnant
of a great sac which once was useful when our
ancestors were vegetarians; now it is worse than
useless, for it is very liable to become irritated and
give rise to what is known as appendicitis.</p>

<p>So long as a quarter of a century ago Sir George
Darwin pointed out<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> that the great theory of
evolution established by his father could be applied
with much advantage to the study of dress, and it
will be seen as we proceed that not the least fascinating
part of the subject are vestiges similar to those
which we have just described, and which have often
survived solely for ornamental reasons.</p>

<p>Many of these are so familiar, that in running the
eye in the ordinary way over a man&rsquo;s usual costume,
attention would not be drawn to them. There is the
band round the outside of his hat and the little bow
inside; the nick in the collar of his coat and the
more or less useless buttons on his sleeves and back;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
while we must not forget the curious ornamentation
on the toes of his boots, nor the crest on his signet
ring.</p>

<p>When, however, an indication is given of the times
and peoples to which these trivialities can be made
to carry us back, interest is aroused to a remarkable
degree. It can also be well maintained, for other
clothes present similar quaint survivals for investigation,
while the evolution of many individual garments
is worth following, and special costumes have been
handed down to the present day, practically unchanged.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the student of dress is in a much
better position than the naturalist proper. The evidence
available when the history of an organism in
past ages is being unravelled, is very scanty in many
cases. Sometimes the fossil remains recovered from
the earth are very perfect and follow one another in
unbroken succession, but they usually consist merely
of the hard parts of the creatures. The individual
development of an organism is also a help, but when
the changes which have taken untold ages to perfect,
are repeated, as in the case of the chicken in the egg,
within the space of a few short weeks, it is not surprising
that much is left out and obscured.</p>

<p>Man has existed in a civilized condition for a comparatively
short time, and there remain all kinds of
records and illustrations, not to mention actual clothes
themselves, which can be consulted or examined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Moreover, primitive men in almost every stage of
culture are, or were till quite lately, to be found
somewhere in the world, and much can be gleaned
from them as to the origin and uses of costume.</p>

<p>There is a point that may be borne in mind when
seeking for curiosities of clothing, and it is that the
more special or ceremonial the occasion, the more
ancient or more primitive the costume which is worn.
In this connection also it may be mentioned that the
dress of the master of one generation may survive as
that of the servant in another.</p>

<span class="sn">Thomas Hood the Younger.</span>
</div></div></div>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> seeking the origin of dress we necessarily assume
that once upon a time our primitive ancestors did
not wear any clothes at all. Even nowadays, in our own
country, at sports, in the ball-room, and on the stage,
the garments worn, or some of them, may be reduced
to the minimum that the rules of Society appear to
demand. There are, moreover, two reasons why very
early man did not trouble to dress: first of all, he
was covered with hair like the majority of mammals;
and, secondly, it is more than probable that his home
was within the tropics. (See Plate <a href="#plate01">I</a>., Frontispiece.)
The two ideas are quite compatible, for all the great
apes&mdash;chimpanzee, orang-utan, and gorilla&mdash;which are
the nearest relatives of man, have been found in the
warmer regions of the world, and are well supplied
with hair.</p>

<p>It has long been thought that the cradle of mankind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
is to be looked for in the south of Asia, and it
is a striking fact that of recent years the bones of
the earliest known creature that can with certainty be
called a man (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pithecanthropus erectus</i>) were discovered
in Java.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> At the same time it appears that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pithecanthropus</i>,
although it walked erect, approximated
more closely to the apes than does any more
recent human being, and in making a restoration
of the type in question, one would feel bound to
endow it with a coat of hair. This has since been
lost, and, according to Darwin, owing to Ã¦sthetic
reasons, the members of one sex having chosen as
mates those of the other who were the least hairy.</p>

<p>Man also has found his way into most parts of the
globe, but he has not always acted with regard to
dress in the same way in similar climates. The
problem, therefore, which we have set ourselves to
solve, proves to be less simple than it appeared at the
outset, for great use may be made of clothes in one
cold country and not in another, while they may be
unknown in certain parts of the tropics, and adopted
elsewhere within their radius.</p>

<p>Very often when it is sought to explain a matter, it
is found that this can be done in two or three different
ways, and it is quite possible that all of them may
be correct. This fact may with advantage be borne
in mind when seeking for the reasons which lead to
the adoption of dress, for the first time, by any
particular race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps it will help us if we pause for a moment to
consider why clothes are worn at the present day.
There is no doubt but that in the case of many
garments their ornamental character, real or supposed,
is the first consideration. Others are chosen
chiefly for protection and warmth, while, as already
indicated, the rest suffice to satisfy the claims of
modesty. Although the three reasons are now intimately
combined, it is practically certain that any one
of them is sufficient to have led to the adoption of
clothes in the first place, and as if these were not
enough there may be other contributing, if not actual
causes.</p>

<p>We may now consider these matters in detail. It
would seem from the study of modern peoples, who
are still in a very simple state of civilization, as well
as from one of the earliest drawings scratched by the
cave-men who were contemporary with the mammoth
in France, that ornaments are the most primitive part
of dress. (See Figure <a href="#fig001">1</a> and Plate <a href="#plate02">II</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 349px;"><a id="plate02"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">A woman and a witch doctor of Central Africa, shewing
the part that ornaments may play even when clothing
is of the scantiest.</span></p>

<p>(<i>From a photograph by Captain Ford.</i>)</p>

<p class="plate"><i>PLATE II.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Generally speaking, the more simple the race, the
greater is its love of ornament. The cave-man&rsquo;s
sketch shows a woman who is devoid of clothing,
but who wears bracelets, while it is said that in the
original a necklace can be traced, though owing to
an injury to the fragment of bone on which the
drawing was made, the head of the figure has been
lost.</p>

<p>On the West Coast of Africa, where clothes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
not a necessity owing to the heat, bracelets are worn
in such numbers by the native belles as to cover a
large part of the forearm, while anklets rise in succession
nearly to the knee. (See Plate <a href="#plate02">II</a>.) Again,
in New Guinea the women of some tribes who do
not indulge in a single scrap of clothing, still wear
ornaments on their heads and round their necks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;"><a id="fig001"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Figure 1.</span>&mdash;Drawing of a woman engraved by a cave-man.</p>

<p>(Modified from Wilson.)</p>
</div></div>

<p>There is, however, something to be advanced on
behalf of savages that cannot be said for white
people who bedizen themselves with jewellery, or
bedeck themselves with the feathers of rare and
beautiful birds. Uncivilized people have no pockets
nor safes in which to keep their valuables, and it
comes about that these take a form which permits
them to be worn on the person, so that many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
objects which take the place of ornaments&mdash;such as
teeth, shells, and beads&mdash;serve as the currencies of
their owners. Even now there are individuals of
whom it is said that they &ldquo;put all their money
on their backs,&rdquo; but, unfortunately for them, it
depreciates sadly in value, and cannot be turned to
account at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Furthermore, one
naked warrior is very much like another, and chiefs,
in order that they may easily be identified, have
come to wear certain ornaments just as at the other
extreme with regard to covering, knights in full
armour carried crests on their helmets and other
devices on their surcoats and shields.</p>

<p>Clothes proper are of later origin, and, as we have
already mentioned, would only be adopted for protective
purposes after man had lost the greater part
of his hairy covering.</p>

<p>It is probable that this had happened before the
earliest settlers arrived in this country, although the
cave-men made their drawings of themselves in the
nude, and it is contended that the marks on their
bodies are similar to those in the drawings of animals
and are not mere attempts at shading, but indicate the
presence of hair.</p>

<p>In the first place, man was a hunter pure and
simple, and his clothes were made from the hairy
skins of his quarry. At the present time the Eskimos
are clothed in this way, and there is little doubt but
that they are the descendants of the cave-men, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
made the striking drawings to which we have already
alluded. Their implements, stature, and so forth,
all point this way, and the fact that their clothes are
merely adopted as a protection against the weather,
is shown by the fact that they remove them altogether
when in their huts.</p>

<p>We have already said that it does not always follow
that even when the climate is cold, complete dress
is brought into use. When H.M.S. <i>Beagle</i> visited
South America, some of the Tierra del Fuegians
wore only an otter skin or some small scrap about
as large as a pocket-handkerchief. It was laced
across the breast by strings, and was shifted from
side to side according to the direction of the wind.
Others, both men and women, wore nothing. One
of the latter, who was suckling a recently born child,
came alongside the vessel in a canoe, and stayed
there, out of pure curiosity, while the sleet fell and
thawed on her naked bosom and on the bare body
of her baby.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>Some races can make very passable clothes by
hammering the fibres from the bark of trees into a
kind of cloth, while when men took to husbandry and
cultivated plants that produce fibres, they learned
also to spin and weave materials from which to make
their garments. The use of furs has always survived
to a greater or less extent, but it is interesting to
note that motoring has caused a return to primitive
dress as regards external garments, for in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
withstand the air which is met when the car is in
rapid movement, fur clothes and leather suits have
been introduced, the latter of course being not quite
so old in type as the former. It must not be forgotten
at this point that climate is not the only enemy
that man has had to face, and that armour was a
development of dress, intended to preserve him from
the onslaughts of his own species.</p>

<p>We have now noticed two ways in which clothes
must have been brought into use, namely, as adornments
and for protection. We have still to consider
the third of the obvious reasons. Modesty is a habit,
or one might perhaps call it equally well a fashion,
which is so widespread that some have characterized
it as being an instinct, and have stated quite wrongly
that it is universal. The most curious point with
regard to the matter is that very different ideas of
modesty prevail in various regions of the world, one
part of the body being covered by some people and
another by others. Besides, it by no means follows
that a naked race is less chaste than one which is
clothed.</p>

<p>Although at the present day races exist where only
the men cover themselves, it is very likely that clothes
worthy of the name were first worn by women, for
keen observers have pointed out that men dependent
on their skill and speed in the chase would hardly
encumber themselves with clothes, though having
comely wives they might deem it advisable for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to be protected from the public gaze. This idea is
still carried out in Eastern countries, where women
cover even the greater part of their faces, and are
usually secluded in a harem. As bearing out, however,
what we have just said with regard to modesty, it
may be mentioned that the peasant women in Egypt
are perfectly happy so long as their faces and the
backs of their heads are covered, and it is considered
even more shameful to expose the latter than
the former. The objection made not long ago to the
appearance of English women in church without hats
may be remembered in this connection.</p>

<p>Painting may often replace clothing, and members
of races accustomed to decorate their bodies in this
way, are much ashamed if they are seen unpainted.
Tattooing also does away to a great extent with
bareness, and it is obvious that unclothed black men
and women never present such a naked appearance
as do lighter-coloured races. In fact, a white man
who bathed with a number of coloured people
likened himself and his companions to an artificial,
blanched, and sickly plant among its healthy dark
green fellows.</p>

<p>Doubtless the hair of original man was coloured
so as to match his surroundings, and it seems likely
that the tint of his skin was reddish. We have now
no need for protective colouration (except in war
time), and as we do not live in the tropics, we
should gain no advantage from being black; therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
pigment is but little developed in our skins, and
it has been suggested that clothes sometimes have
been adopted by white races for Ã¦sthetic reasons apart
from their development from ordinary ornaments.</p>

<p>It seems possible, too, that man, upon realizing that
he differed from other animals in having no natural
covering, set about to provide himself with one.</p>

<p>There is, however, another contributing cause which
may have led to the adoption of dress, and this
depends on the action of women themselves. They
may put on clothes for reasons of coquetry just as on
occasion they may modify or discard them. For
instance, fashion at a moment&rsquo;s notice may obscure
one part of the body that hitherto was obvious, and
at the same time emphasize the natural outlines of
others which before were hidden. Again, the bare
necks and arms displayed in our ball-rooms afford
another case in point.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">III</a><br />

DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODERN COAT</h2>

<p class="srt2">THE ANCESTRAL SHAWL&mdash;PROBLEMATICAL BUTTONS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Now</span> that we have considered the origin of dress
as a whole, we may turn with advantage to
the evolution of individual garments. People are
very often pleased to allude to what are called the
vagaries of fashion, but it is curious to notice how
little real change is made in costume at the present
time. The really useful characters are always retained,
and our modern clothes can be reduced to
a very few types. A skirt is a skirt whether it falls
naturally, is held out all round with a hoop, or
crinoline, or is only supported behind by what at
one time was known as an &ldquo;improver.&rdquo; And in the
same way it may be said that trousers remain trousers
whether they have bell bottoms or are peg tops.</p>

<p>Even types which we recognize as being quite
distinct, are often so closely related as to cause
surprise when their family history is made known.
Although it constantly alters as regards details, which
from a constructional point of view are quite unimportant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
woman&rsquo;s dress does not seem to have varied
to any very great extent. Consequently, there are
not quite so many curious features to be seen as in the
ordinary clothes or uniforms of men. On the other
hand, however, we may with greater reason hope to
find that some primitive characters have survived until
the present day.</p>

<p>No article of clothing could well be simpler than
the shawl, and though there is an art in its arrangement,
the only point in its structure that would
appear to invite attention is the presence of a fringe
on only two sides. This seems to be a small matter,
but it takes us straight back to the time when men
had ceased to be hunters merely, and having become
agriculturists had learned, as we have already indicated,
to weave fibres with the help of simple looms.
From the cloth thus made clothes were constructed,
though skins continued to be used as outer mantles.
When the stuff was taken from these early looms,
the threads of the warp were left hanging from two
opposite edges, and the fringe that we have now on
our shawls is a direct survival of this accidental
occurrence.</p>

<p>There seems not the slightest doubt but that we
can trace the coat from the shawl. A simple improvement
in the latter is to join two edges of the
shawl together and make a tunic. Such a tubular
garment was used in Greece, and, with some slight
modifications, is worn by Egyptian women to-day. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
came up to the armpits, was gathered up on to each
shoulder and fastened with two brooches. (Figure <a href="#fig002">2</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;"><a id="fig002"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Sketch showing the development of the tunic.<br />
In this stage it has no arms.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The next stage in development would be a sleeved
tunic, and how easily this could be derived from a
shawl can be seen by putting a narrow one over the
shoulders and lifting up the arms as shown in Figure <a href="#fig003">3</a>.
The material has only to be sewn together under the
arms, and if necessary cut into shape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Diagram showing the way in which a sleeved tunic is derived
from the shawl.</p>
</div></div>

<p>If the front be not sewn up, we get the coat as we
know it; if the edges be joined along half their length
or more, then we have a sleeved tunic, a shirt, or vest
(see Plate <a href="#plate03">III</a>). The smock-frock (see Figure <a href="#fig004">4</a>)
and gown are more voluminous, while the jersey is
short again, and has only a small opening at the
neck. An interesting garment is found among the
costumes of the Bronze Age chieftains of Denmark
and their wives, which have been preserved in the
oak coffins of these people, owing to the action of
tannin from the wood which has preserved the woven
material.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> The article in question belonged to one
of the women, and though the front edges are joined
for a short distance, it is practically a jacket. The
sleeves are made all in one piece, and the garment is
very nearly as highly evolved as the Cardigan jacket,
which it very much resembles. (See Figure <a href="#fig005">5</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>It is by this time clear, that several important
garments are the descendants of the shawl, which is
still used by men in the British Isles under the title of
the plaid, or maud.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Though differing, of course, in detail, the upper
garments of men and women agree in general construction.
One of the points alluded to is worthy of
mention, namely, that the buttons on a man&rsquo;s coat
are on the right side and the buttonholes on his left,
while in the case of women&rsquo;s attire the exact opposite
is found&mdash;at least, so far as one can ascertain&mdash;in
European countries. In the East, the little knobs
which are passed through loops and take the place of
buttons, may in the women&rsquo;s dress be on the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
side, and in other Asiatic costumes the same thing
holds good. In connection with this peculiarity, it
may be pointed out that men and women have
different ways of doing up buttons. The man takes
hold of the button with his right hand, puts his left
thumb into the buttonhole and pushes the button
against it. Then he pulls the stuff over with his right
forefinger and pushes the button through with his
right thumb while he guides it with his left.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Woman&rsquo;s dress showing buttons on the left side.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The woman, on the other hand, puts her right
thumb through the buttonhole, takes hold of the
button with the fingers of the same hand, and finally,
if the other hand is at liberty, brings it up to finish the
process. (See Figures <a href="#fig006">6</a> to <a href="#fig010-011">11</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>To explain the difference in the position of the
buttons is not by any means easy. In the correspondence
which has arisen out of lectures which the
writer has given on the evolution of dress, it has, in
the first place, been suggested that the arrangement
of his clothing permitted a man to thrust his right
and fighting arm into his jacket in order to keep it
warm. This explanation, of course, does not account
for the variation in the case of women.</p>

<p>Dr. Lyman, of Baltimore, has submitted the theory
that a man wearing a loose cloak, toga, or plaid,
would grasp it with the left hand and thrust the left
side over the right so as to leave the right-hand free
in order to hold a weapon or implement. A woman
would grasp her attire with her right hand, and push
it over the left side and leave her left arm unencumbered,
wherewith to carry a child. It would, however,
seem more natural for the right side to be pulled over
the left, but it is unlikely that a man would fight
in a loose cloak, and the toga was only worn in times
of peace. Moreover, the jacket, as we have seen, was
developed from the cloak through the tunic. A tunic
was worn under the toga, and as the only loose edge
of the latter lies in the same way as the buttonhole
side of a man&rsquo;s coat, it is feasible that the edges of
the tunic beneath would for convenience be made to
lap the same way.</p>

<p>To turn to women&rsquo;s dress, it is customary, as Dr.
Lyman says, to carry children on the left arm, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
they are allowed to suck the left breast to a greater
extent than the other. The left side of a bodice
could, if the right lapped over it, be pulled back
without exposing so much of the person as if the
reverse held good, and in the case of tightly-fitting
clothing, if the buttons have to be done up with the
right hand alone, the task is made easier. Another
interesting little point of difference between the
clothes of the two sexes is, that while the buttons
on a man&rsquo;s wristbands are on the thumb side, those
of a woman are on that which corresponds with the
little finger. This arrangement is no doubt correlated
with that previously discussed, but the reason for it
is not obvious.</p>

BUTTONS AS CHRONICLES</h2>

<p class="srt2">EPISODES IN THE LATER HISTORY OF THE COAT AND CUFFS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">We</span> have gained some insight into the development
of garments as a whole, and no doubt
it is now obvious that the little details of construction
will prove by no means the least attractive part of
our subject. It has become customary to refer to
a button as typifying something of specially small
account, though very often much may depend in
practice upon one of these despised articles.</p>

<p>We have already shown that the mere position of
a few buttons that are still useful, may raise most
curious points, and in the present chapter we shall
proceed to investigate some episodes in the later
history of the coat which have left their mark upon
it, to a great extent in the shape of useless buttons.
This topic will be dealt with in some detail, so that
it may serve as a guide to those of our readers who
may be induced to undertake the fascinating study
of survivals in dress. Afterwards, the general survey
of modern clothes will be continued, and here and
there lines of research will be indicated, while some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
problems will be left for our readers to solve. In the
second part of the book, it is intended to deal with
a certain number of costumes which have been handed
down to us as they are.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;"><a id="fig012"></a>
<img src="images/fig012.png" width="151" height="131" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;The buttons on the back of a policeman&rsquo;s great coat.</p>
</div></div>

<p>At the present time there are usually to be seen
two buttons on the back of civilians&rsquo; coats, except in
the case of lounge suits and dinner jackets, and there
may be four or more on the great coats of policemen
(see Figure <a href="#fig012">12</a>) and on the tunics of some soldiers.
The first question which we will endeavour to answer
is, Why are they there? The two upper buttons in the
case of uniforms are now used to support a belt, and
at first sight it looks as if they were originally intended
for this purpose. Their adoption in other
cases might then be put down as a survival from a
time when civilians carried swords. Unfortunately
for this theory, it can be shown that the sword-belt
was not necessarily worn outside the coat (see
Figures <a href="#fig018">18</a> and <a href="#fig019">19</a>).</p>

<p>We must therefore look round for further evidence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and we find that those coats which bear the pair of
buttons, have a slit up the middle which gives rise to
the skirts or tails. This arrangement carries us back
to the time when there were no railways and few conveyances;
when men commonly travelled on horseback
and their whole attire was adapted to this end,
so that they were ready for the saddle at a moment&rsquo;s
notice. The division in the coat which we are considering,
allowed one tail to fall conveniently on each
side of the horse after its rider had mounted it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;"><a id="fig013"></a>
<img src="images/fig013.png" width="184" height="199" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>&mdash;The buttons that close the slit up the back of an ulster.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In long overcoats of to-day we find only a short
slit, left for convenience in walking (see Figure <a href="#fig013">13</a>);
but it has a special interest for us, as in connection
with it there are two or three buttons and buttonholes,
usually hidden, which allow of the opening
being closed up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, then, we have buttons on the back of the
coat still serving a useful purpose, and it is not at
all difficult to trace the series of fastenings back to
a much longer one, which in the seventeenth century
was quite obvious. (See Figure <a href="#fig014">14</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;"><a id="fig014"></a>
<img src="images/fig014.png" width="138" height="303" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span>&mdash;A back view of a seventeenth-century coat
showing the buttons and buttonholes.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Each button and buttonhole was placed in the
middle of similar pieces of lace or embroidery, so
that the sides of the coat were made to look symmetrical.
The object in view was the keeping of the skirts
of the coat together when the wearer was not on
horseback. At the present day the buttons have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
been duplicated and are on both sides of the coat,
and they are still sewn to ornamental pieces in the
uniform of the Grenadier Guards. The presence of
the lower buttons on uniforms and coats is therefore
explained. It might be assumed that the topmost
button had also been doubled and raised above the
slit, and that in this way we have obtained the two
ornaments on the back of our coats.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;"><a id="fig015"></a>
<img src="images/fig015.png" width="184" height="247" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>&mdash;The tab and buttons on the back of a soldier&rsquo;s
great coat which make a temporary waist.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Before accepting such a solution of the problem,
however, it may be well to see if the buttons may
not have had another origin; and on looking for some
clue we find that two folds take their rise from the
point where the buttons are situated. These may be
expected to throw some light upon the question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
The folds are now permanent, but on a voluminous
coat, such as still used by horse soldiers, they can be
produced temporarily (see Figure <a href="#fig015">15</a>) by setting the
two buttons further apart and running a tab from one
to the other. Sir George Darwin has attempted to
carry the history of these two buttons still further
back.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> He has expressed the opinion that each is
one of a pair that originally kept in place a small tab
at the side of the coat, and so helped to produce
a waist when required. (See Figures <a href="#fig017">17</a> and <a href="#fig018">18</a>.)</p>

<p>In some drawings of coats (see Figure <a href="#fig018">18</a>) the side
tabs and their corresponding buttons are shown in
addition to those on the back of the coat.</p>

<p>There is, however, evidence to show that the buttons
were originally on the sides of the coat, for they are
so wide apart as to be to all intents and purposes in
that position, on the uniform overcoats of the London
Electric Tramway drivers. (See Figure <a href="#fig016">16</a>.)</p>

<p>They may well represent the topmost buttons of
the lateral series, still found on the overcoat of the
members of the Corps of Commissionaires. In
this case there are three buttons on each side, of
which the middle one is used for fastening the side-pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>It is worth while to consider side-pockets, which in
their turn are remnants of lateral openings which
were made in coats at the end of the seventeenth and
the beginning of the following centuries. The sword-handle
conveniently protruded through the left-hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
slit, which, like its fellow, ran from the waist to the
lower margin of the coat or stopped half-way. (See
Figures <a href="#fig018">18</a> and <a href="#fig019">19</a>.) In the latter case, the arrangement
very much resembles the vertical pocket which
has become common again of recent years. (See
Figure <a href="#fig020">20</a>.)</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Occasionally a tab, such as that to which reference
has been made, kept the parts of the coat together;
but often there were buttons and buttonholes, at least
at the upper end of the openings. These survive in
several cases, such as in the overcoat of the commissionaire,
while the pocket is sometimes represented
by a mere flap (see Figure <a href="#fig021">21</a>) ornamented
with buttons as on the livery of certain footmen.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;Coat skirts buttoned
back (after Hogarth).</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>To sum up the matter, the topmost pair of buttons
has come from the fastenings of the side slit and the
lower ones from those of the back slit. Buttons on
the skirt behind have in the meantime had a very
intimate connection with the evolution of the &ldquo;swallow-tail&rdquo;
coat (see Figure <a href="#fig024">24</a>). They were used to fasten
the corners of the ordinary riding-coat together, so
that the linings should not be injured by the sweat
of the horses. (See Figure <a href="#fig022">22</a>.)</p>

<p>Mr. Deane Butcher tells me that he can remember
this buttoning back being done in the case of his
uncle, when the latter rode to market or to church;
but in this case it was the two uppermost buttons
which were again brought into use. At dances the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
coats were also subjected to similar treatment, and
what at first was a temporary condition afterwards
became a permanent one. It is obvious that the
turned-back lining would often be of a different colour
from the outside of the coat, and facings on old
uniforms, and in that of the present dress of a lord-lieutenant
(see Figure <a href="#fig023">23</a>) are derived from the practice
of fastening the corners of the coat together. In
the &ldquo;swallow-tail&rdquo; the outer corners have been cut
right away. (See Figure <a href="#fig024">24</a>.)</p>

<p>The buttons, in the interesting cases which we have
described, have been allowed to remain as part and
parcel of our costume on account of their decorative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
character, and in a great measure the same is true of
those on coat cuffs (see Figure <a href="#fig025">25</a>). In many cases
there are proper buttonholes, and it is possible to
undo the sleeve buttons; but occasionally the arrangement
has degenerated and the buttonholes are imitations
or only the buttons remain.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>&mdash;Turned-back cuff, end of

</div></div></div>

<p>To find an explanation of this feature we shall have
to go back again to the seventeenth century, when so
much was expended upon coats that it became advisable
to turn back the cuffs out of harm&rsquo;s way. To
hold them in position, series of buttons and buttonholes
were devised, and just as the turning back of
the skirts was at first temporary and afterwards came
to be done once for all when the coat was made, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the turned-back cuff grew into a permanent institution.
In Figure <a href="#fig026">26</a> the buttons are one above the other as
in modern dress, but in the next two Figures (<a href="#fig027">27</a> and
<a href="#fig028">28</a>) they are horizontal.</p>

<div class="container">

</div></div></div>

<p>A survival of this arrangement can still be seen in
the coat sleeves of the higher clergy. In ordinary
dress, the turned-back edge of the cuff may now only
be represented by a band of braid or a row of stitches;
but in soldiers&rsquo; uniforms, an ornamented cuff persists
which represents in reality the lining of the sleeve.
Again, the turned-back cuff is actually present in the
clothes of costermongers, and has been revived on
overcoats to a considerable extent during the last few
years. (See Figure <a href="#fig029">29</a>.)</p>

<p>As a rule, too, the vertical pocket already described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
accompanies the turned-back cuff, as it did some
centuries ago. (See Figure <a href="#fig020">20</a>.)</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>It must not be forgotten that buttons have long
been used on narrow sleeves. They are undone when
the hand is to be pushed through the cuff, and afterwards
fastened for the sake of warmth or to give a
neat appearance. It is therefore possible that the
ring of buttons is more properly a survival of the
time when cuffs were turned back to preserve them,
and that the vertical row is really of earlier origin.
A uniform represented by Hogarth (Figure <a href="#fig030">30</a>) shows
both the row of buttons and the turned-back cuff,
which seems to be quite independent of them.</p>

<p>In this instance we may have the degenerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
turned-back cuff and one revived, shown together.
Such a case, we need scarcely point out, could hardly
occur in the case of an animal structure, for if by a
&ldquo;throw back&rdquo; or &ldquo;reversion to type&rdquo; we get a
vestigial character once more fully reproduced, we
cannot expect the original structure and the vestige
to be shown at the same time.</p>

<p>The adoption of buttons more or less for ornament
has long been practised. John Brandon, who died
in the year 1364, is shown on his brass (in the church
of St. Mary, King&rsquo;s Lynn) with no less than forty
buttons on the sleeves of his undervest, which has
embroidered cuffs and is buttoned to the elbow (see
Plate <a href="#plate04">IV</a>). We shall, however, have something more
to say with regard to buttons from this and other
points of view as we proceed.</p>

<p class="plate"><i>PLATE IV.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>An interesting case of superfluous buttons on the
front of clothes is to be seen in the case of the short
jackets of the postilions, belonging to His Majesty
the King. There is a useful row down the middle
which closes the garment, and two ornamental rows
which start from each shoulder and curve downwards
towards the middle row. These are probably vestiges
of buttons that were once of use, and to seek an explanation
it might be well to study some uniforms of
the past. We shall find that in the eighteenth century
it was customary to button back the revers of
the uniform coat, as in the case of the French coast-guard
officer of 1775. (See Figure <a href="#fig031">31</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Fashion afterwards decreed that the coats should
be fastened again with hooks, but the two rows of
buttons remained.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;The uniform of a coast-guard officer of 1775<br />

</div></div>

<p>In the coat of the postilion there is no trace of
the revers which showed the lining, and were consequently
of a different colour from the rest of the
coat. We find, however, in the peculiar uniform of the
Lancers that there are the two side rows of buttons,
to which is fastened a red front. This appears to
represent the two revers combined. In the present
year, 1907, a number of ladies&rsquo; dresses are to be seen
in which the revers trimmed with a different material
from the dress are buttoned back against the latter.</p>

<p>In some ceremonial dresses and uniforms there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
cross stripes on the breast (see Figure <a href="#fig061">61</a>) which, it
has been pointed out, represent series of buttonholes
which have become hypertrophied, and are now
exaggerated beyond recognition. The braid on the
cuff of the London Scottish Volunteers seems also to
represent buttonholes.</p>

<p>Such features as turned-back cuffs occur in women&rsquo;s
clothes, and, as we have seen, the arrangement of
buttons may be copied from masculine attire. In
other cases buttons seem to appear which have, it
would seem, no hereditary right to their position; but
it may be well, before dismissing them, to see whether
they have not a pedigree. We might cite the case of
the buttons that are sewn on to the frocks a little
below the knee. They are often at the head of a
plait, and it would be worth while to look into their

COLLARS AND BANDS</h2>

<p class="srt2">NICKS IN COAT LAPELS&mdash;THE WHY AND WHEREFORE OF
THE WHITE SHIRT FRONT</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Let</span> us carry on our work of dissecting the
clothes of a modern man, and as we once more
survey our subject, we may glance a little higher
than heretofore, until our eyes rest upon the collar of
his coat. This structure passes into the lapels, and
at the point of junction there is a curious nick which
is repeated in the waistcoat if this be similarly provided
with lapels. (See Figure <a href="#fig032">32</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span>&mdash;A stage when the nick was useful

</div></div>

<p>There is always a temptation to invent some interesting
theory in order to explain the origin of
vestiges, and a penny paper, which hardly boasts of
scientific accuracy, not long ago informed its readers
that the slit in the coat lapel is the outcome of a
&ldquo;unique and beautiful custom among the orthodox
Jews,&rdquo; for in former days, when death visited a Jew&rsquo;s
household, he cut the lapel of his coat. It was undoubtedly
a custom of the Jews to rend their garments,
but it does not, on the face of it, seem likely
that the practice would have influenced modern costume.
It would appear, however, that the slit in the
lapel has a much more prosaic origin, and owes its existence
rather to a practical requirement than to a sentimental
observance. When the collar of a coat is made to
stand up, it is absolutely necessary that a piece should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
be cut out of the cloth, or the lapel will not lie down.
In the exaggerated garment of which we give an
illustration (see Figure <a href="#fig033">33</a>) this need is most manifest;
but a moment&rsquo;s thought will show that the provision
must be made, even if the collar be small. A trifling
experiment will indicate that at the present day the
cut is not usually made deep enough to allow of the
collar being turned up without disturbing the lapels.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 14em;"><a id="fig034"></a>
<img src="images/fig034.png" width="137" height="190" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span>&mdash;The &ldquo;toothpick&rdquo; on a dress coat.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Another remarkable variation is to be found in the
collars of some dress suits. A little point is left on
the collar known to tailors as the &ldquo;toothpick,&rdquo; which
runs across the nick into the lapel (see Figure <a href="#fig034">34</a>).
This structure is probably a survival of some particular
kind of collar.</p>

<p>It might be pointed out here that the facings and
collar that are of silk or velvet represent the lining of
the coat which came into view when the collar was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
turned down and the lapels turned back. The case is
quite similar to that of the cuffs on uniforms, and to
be quite consistent, the whole coat should be lined
with what is usually used now only as a kind of
trimming.</p>

<p>It is but a short step from the features that we have
been discussing, to the linen collar and the shirt front.
The cutting away of the outer garment to bring the
shirt into view is a relic of the time when only those
who were very well to do could afford to wear linen,
and they showed it, in order to indicate their social
position, or at any rate their financial resources. At
the same time, the women cut their dresses low so as
to show their underlinen; and not content with this,
they further, at the end of the thirteenth century, slit
their gowns from the armpits to the hips. The openings
thus made were laced across, so that the linen
garments beneath could easily be seen.</p>

<p>The white shirt has long survived, and in spite of
its depreciated value has up to quite recently posed
as a badge of respectability. Now at last there are
signs that its sway is over, and that soon it will come
to be only a garment of ceremony.</p>

<p>The linen collar of to-day is quite a small affair
compared with some of its forerunners. An interesting
relic is to be seen in the two little linen flaps which
we call bands (see Figure <a href="#fig035">35</a>). These are still worn by
preachers in conjunction with the Geneva gown, by
barristers, and by Blue-coat boys (see Figure <a href="#fig036">36</a>), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
we can easily trace their relationship to the collar.
Until a few years ago the choristers at Jesus College,
Cambridge, wore a peculiar collar which ended in
two flaps much resembling bands, and the descent
of this from the large structures which were called
falling bands is not difficult to trace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The portrait of Jan Steen, which we reproduce,
shows bands which are less stiff and formal, but of
ampler proportions. (See Figure <a href="#fig038">38</a>.)</p>

<p>Going a little further back, we find the collar that
covered the shoulders, such as Milton wore, and
which is shown in our picture of John Pym. (See
Figure <a href="#fig039">39</a>.)</p>

<p>At this point we may pause to recall a simple article
which is known as a bandbox, but which has been
diverted from its original purpose of holding bands,
and is now commonly used as a receptacle for hats.
Though not itself part of dress, the bandbox furnishes
an interesting instance of adaptation to circumstances.
It was well suited to contain articles of dress other
than those for which it was primarily intended, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
hence it has survived in the struggle for existence.
(See Figure <a href="#fig040">40</a>.)</p>

<div class="container">

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span>&mdash;Bands that survive at the
present day.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>We must not, however, jump to the conclusion that
bands are now only represented by vestiges, for they
are still to be seen in their full glory on very small
boys (see Figure <a href="#fig041">41</a>), and the writer recalls a lad of
fourteen or so who had reached the dignity of trousers
who wore the same kind of collar. As he also had
a trencher, or in common parlance, a &ldquo;mortar-board,&rdquo;
it is possible that he was not an isolated survival,
but belonged to some school which adopted a special
costume.</p>

<p>As linen collars are one of the articles of dress in
regard to which the wearer is allowed in a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
measure to follow his own taste, it is not surprising
that a great many forms have from time to time been
invented. Quite a number are still to be seen here
and there, while the development of the more fashionable
shapes one from the other would, in itself, form
a chapter in the Evolution of Dress. The clerical
collar may be singled out, as it fastens behind like the
bands, though the reason for this is not at all obvious.</p>

<p>In recalling the great ruffs and expanded collars of
Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, one may be inclined to smile
at the lengths to which a fad may be carried, and the
curious, not to say monstrous, structures that are its
culminations. These, like the huge creatures of bygone
ages, die out, but differ in this respect that they
sometimes revive for a time. For instance, only a
few years have passed since the collars of ladies&rsquo;
mantles stood up round the back of their heads; but
as the collars usually lacked the decoration and colour
of the Elizabethan period, they appeared as if they
were intended merely to keep the draught from the
necks of their wearers, and they did not last for long.</p>

VESTIGES IN THE HAT</h2>

<p class="srt2">HOW HATS WERE EVOLVED&mdash;WHY PLUMES ARE ON THE
LEFT SIDE&mdash;THE GROWTH OF THE BUSBY&mdash;HELMETS AND
COCKED HATS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Those</span> who have written upon dress from an
artistic point of view have recognized that
costume and architecture are affected by the same
influences. When we come to the hat, we find that
its name is connected with a building of a primitive
character, namely, a hut. Mr. Allan Poe Newcombe,
an architect, some years ago pointed out the curious
resemblance which has existed, and is still to be found
in many countries, between headgear and habitations
or other buildings.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> It may be that the cases which
have been collected together are mere coincidences,
though it must be allowed that they are both numerous
and striking. It may be that the same taste, or lack
of it, has given rise to the similarity of style, or in the
beginning, the designer of the hat may have taken
the hut as a model.</p>

<p>In the Hawaiian Islands, long before the inhabitants
troubled about clothes, they built themselves grass
houses, and at the present time the characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Hawaiian hat is remarkably like the hut. The
turbans of Eastern Church dignitaries are still of
the same shape as those worn by the high priests
among the Jews, and are remarkably like the characteristic
dome which surmounts a mosque. (See
Figure <a href="#fig042">42</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;"><a id="fig042"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span>&mdash;The turban of a Jewish priest (after Kitto) compared with
the dome of the Mosque of Omar.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Looking about in other countries we shall find
further instances that support Mr. Newcombe&rsquo;s contention;
our illustration of a Siamese head-dress and
building is a case in point. (See Figure <a href="#fig043">43</a>.)</p>

<p>Again going back into European history, we find
that the high pointed spires of Gothic churches were
cotemporaneous with the high horn-like head-dress
known as the hennin (see Figure <a href="#fig044">44</a>). It is claimed,
moreover, that like results will be found after a comparison
of other styles of architecture with the costume
of the period in which they flourished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving this suggestive line of research, and
coming to hats as we have them at the present day,
we find that they offer several remarkable vestiges for
our consideration. First of all there is the hat-band
outside, which sometimes ends in two tails or streamers
that hang from the back of the hat (see Figure <a href="#fig047">47</a>).
From the bow usually present it is evident that the
hat-band was tied, and the streamers represent the
loose ends. As a matter of fact, primitively, a head-dress
was made from a piece of cloth, round which
a fillet was tied so that it fitted the head. In this
connexion Figure <a href="#fig045">45</a> is most interesting. It represents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the back view of the head of the Egyptian
woman of the Sixth Dynasty, who is seen in
Figure <a href="#fig076">76</a>, and shows a head-dress which is confined
with a fillet that is tied at the back so as to make
two tails.</p>

<p>The modern Arab fastens his kefiyeh with a twist
of camel&rsquo;s hair without streamers, and the lady of the
fourteenth century, shown in Figure <a href="#fig046">46</a>, has also an
ordinary band.</p>

<p>The child&rsquo;s sailor hat and the Scotch cap are among
the modern head coverings which retain the strings
(Figure <a href="#fig049">49</a>). A twelfth-century head-dress shown in
a manuscript (Figure <a href="#fig048">48</a>) has a great similarity to the
Scotch cap, as the band forms a kind of binding to
the article in both cases, and there are streamers to
both.</p>

<div class="container">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The strings or streamers are to be found in many
other head coverings, including the mitres of bishops
(see Figure <a href="#fig050">50</a>). The particular mitre illustrated is
that of the See of Durham, which is distinguished
from others in being plumed.</p>

<div class="container">

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 50.</span>&mdash;A mitre of the See of

</div></div></div>

<p>An interesting suggestion as to the origin of the slit
in the top of the mitre may be mentioned here. Head-dresses
were used in very early times which were in
the form of a fish&rsquo;s head, and it has been thought that
the slit in the mitre, so distinctly shown in chess-men,
represents the fish&rsquo;s mouth.</p>

<p>On looking at the inside of a modern hat, a little
bow of silk ribbon will usually be found at the back
where the two edges of the leather lining meet. Here,
again, is a vestige. (See Figure <a href="#fig051">51</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.</span>&mdash;Small vestigial bow of ribbon in a modern hat.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In some hats the ribbon does not simply make the
bow, but it is threaded through a greater or less
number of holes in the leather, though now fulfilling
no useful purpose. (See Figure <a href="#fig052">52</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 18em;"><a id="fig052"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span>&mdash;A hat with the remains of lacing.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>In a hunting hat, however (see Figure <a href="#fig053">53</a>), the
lacing is continuous round the hat, and the lining can
be made to fit the wearer. It helps to form a buffer,
should the huntsman unfortunately fall on his head,
and it is claimed that many lives have been saved by
this small detail.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 18em;"><a id="fig053"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.</span>&mdash;A hunting hat with complete lacing inside.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It may be gathered from the description that in
times when hats could not easily be got to fit their
wearers, the lacing inside would be most useful, as
it ensured that the size could be adjusted.</p>

<p>It is possible also that in the lacing we have a
means by which a hat was originally shaped, and
that the lace is really a hat-band threaded through
the material of the head-dress instead of being tied
round outside. The first diagram on page <a href="#Page_57">57</a> shows
a flat piece of leather cut into a circular form; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
next shows it perforated and a lace put through the
openings; the third indicates how by tightening the
string a crown could be made to the hat.</p>

<p>In time, when the crown was made in different ways,
it would be easy to transfer the lacing to the lining as
seen already in the hunting hat (Figure <a href="#fig053">53</a>).</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that a small bow is also
found inside ladies&rsquo; hats, and often used as a place on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
which to put the name of the maker. (See Figure
<a href="#fig058">58</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.</span>&mdash;Plumes on the left side.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Sir George Darwin has shown why plumes are, and
used to be, on the left side of a hat only. In the days
when the feathers were particularly long there was
also plenty of fighting, and it only needs the attention
to be drawn to the point, to make one realize that if
the plume had been on the right side, it might often
have got in the way of a sword and thereby caused
the overthrow or even death of its wearer. At the
present day in the army (see Figure <a href="#fig059">59</a>), the plumes
will be found on the left side as in the days of
cavaliers.</p>

<p>Sir George Darwin<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> has traced the origin of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
busby, and has shown that the little red flap that hangs
on the left side as a useless appendage is really the
original cap. Busbies were the special attributes of
the Hussars, who were originally Hungarian soldiers.
It is the peasant&rsquo;s cap of Hungary that is the forerunner
of the military head-dress which we are considering,
and it consisted of a red cap of cloth with
a band of fur round the edge. As time went on, the
fur on the cap, which was adopted in the end by
various regiments, became wider and wider, and the
original red cap got smaller and smaller until the form
of the modern busby was reached. In some cases even
the flap already mentioned has gone, though the fact
that the top of the busby is made of cloth instead of
fur still points to its origin. (See Figures <a href="#fig060">60</a> and <a href="#fig061">61</a>.)</p>

<p>Though we are not discussing armour at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
moment, we may say while speaking of military
head-dresses that metal helmets are still in use in a
few regiments. The helmet also of the fireman
deserves attention, as it is practically of the same
type as that worn by the ancient Greeks. (See

</div></div></div>

<p>The cocked hat should also claim our attention,
and it gives us another instance of temporary alterations
which have ultimately become permanent. The
picture of Hudibras shows an early stage in the
history of cocking. The strings which connect the
brim of a bishop&rsquo;s tall hat to the crown are evidently
connected with this practice. In the modern cocked
hat more of the right side is turned up than of
the left. A little careful examination will render
its development from the broad-brimmed hat easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
understood, while the representatives of the hat-band
and the details of the cocking will be soon
discovered.</p>

<p>The cock of the hat formed a convenient spot in
which to fix an ornament, and the name cockade has
come to be applied to such an addition, borne on the
hat, as a mark to distinguish the wearer.</p>

<p>The part which cockades have played in history is
considerable, but as they are now chiefly associated
with the liveries of men-servants they will be considered
later on in the book. Before, however, we
leave, for the present, the subject of head coverings,
we ought to mention that a piece of woven material
as primitively used without even a restraining band,
still survives in the shape of the small shawl which
north-country girls and women very generally wear
over their heads. The head-dress of the nun is
another case in point, and recalls that in vogue in
Tudor times, while the sun-bonnet of the barge and
market women, though more highly developed, still
consists to a considerable extent of simple drapery.</p>

SHOES AND STOCKINGS</h2>

<p class="srt2">EARLY FOOT-GEAR&mdash;THE ORIGIN OF THE CLOCK&mdash;A MODERN
IMITATION OF TATTOOING&mdash;GAILY COLOURED GARTERS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Many</span> persons still go barefoot, so that ancient
as foot-gear may be, the stage preceding its
adoption is even now represented. Moreover, sandals,
which are very primitive, have been much in use of
recent years, and have especially been worn by
children.</p>

<p>If we turn to ordinary boots and shoes we shall
not find many obvious points about them which lead
up to their history. Still we shall see in the case of
a large number that in places where one piece of
leather laps over another, it is perforated with rows
of holes which form a kind of simple ornamentation.
(See Figure <a href="#fig064">64</a>.)</p>

<p>The perforations do not go through the boot or
shoe, and in a Roman example in the British Museum,
which is much more highly decorated, there are two
thicknesses of leather, of which the outer one only is
pierced. (See Figure <a href="#fig065">65</a>.)</p>

<p>In many cases, however, the Roman shoe was
truly of open work. It consisted of but one thickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of leather, and from this, large pieces were cut
out so as to make a kind of lattice. Several examples
of this kind of shoe are exhibited at the British
Museum, and we give an illustration of one of these,
which is in a very fair state of preservation. (See
Figure <a href="#fig066">66</a>.)</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>It seems very probable that the ornamentation on
our modern shoes is a survival of the open work
which was in favour with the Romans, especially as
even then the apertures did not always expose the
foot. In pre-Roman times in this country there were
perforations in some of the shoes which were useful
rather than ornamental, and one type (of which a
specimen figured by Fairholt is preserved by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Royal Irish Academy) has survived until recently, if
it is not to be found to-day, in Scotland and Ireland.
This shoe was made of raw hide (see Figure <a href="#fig067">67</a>), and
the holes, it is said, were intended to allow the water
to pass through when the wearer was crossing
morasses. An examination of the figure will, however,
show that the holes are really slits, and it would
appear that however useful they may have proved in
the way described, they were originally made for
quite a different reason.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 14em;"><a id="fig067"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span>&mdash;A hide shoe of pre-Roman type
from Ireland (after Fairholt).</p>
</div></div>

<p>The most primitive kind of shoe would doubtless
be a piece of hide placed under the foot and brought
up over the toes and round the heel. It would make
a rather unprepossessing bundle, and there would be
awkward puckers where the hide was gathered up.
If the superfluous material at the toe were cut away,
we should have a slit in every case where there had
previously been a fold. This state of affairs is
exactly what is to be seen in the Irish shoe, where
the strips of leather that are left are held in place by
a thong. In an ingenious way, apparently with the
help of the same lace, the difficulty of securing a fit
at the heel has also been got over. The result is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
very neat shoe indeed, though in reality it is only the
original flat piece of hide.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span>&mdash;The original top boot with the upper part
temporarily turned down.</p>
</div></div>

<p>One of the most perfect instances of vestiges, as
Sir George Darwin points out, is afforded by top
boots. In their original form, still to be seen in our
streets on sewer men, the boots were made to come
above the knee, but fashion decreed that the top
should be turned back (see Figure <a href="#fig068">68</a>), and so it came
about that the inside became visible, as did also the
tags, with the help of which the boots were pulled
on. When the outside of the boots was blacked it
would form a distinct contrast to the inside, which
remained brown, and in modern top boots the
difference in colour has been in many cases greatly
accentuated. Indeed, the upper parts are made of
different leather, and as ordinary coat cuffs are now
incapable of being turned down, the tops of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
boots are immovable and cannot be turned up. It is
curious, however, that the tags at the sides are still
represented and sewn to the boot so as to be quite
useless, while new tags placed inside the boot now
do their duty. (See Figure <a href="#fig069">69</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span>&mdash;Puttees.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Socks and stockings are, at the present time, the
most usual coverings for the lower parts of the legs,
and there is at least one vestige which remains in
their structure that has an interest for us. Before we
consider this, however, we may look at another
means of protecting the lower extremities which
tells of more primitive conditions. The leg bandages
so commonly worn by our regular soldiers and
volunteers are the case in point. (See Figure <a href="#fig070">70</a>.)
These appear to have been immediately derived from
the Indian Army, and their name&mdash;&ldquo;puttees&rdquo;&mdash;is
evidence of this; but such an arrangement is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
widespread, and was that generally adopted in this
country in Anglo-Saxon times. Our illustration is
taken from an illuminated manuscript prepared for
St. Aethelwold for use at Winchester, which was
completed between the years 963 and 964 <span class="f8">A.D.</span> Bandaged
stockings are common on representations of
Anglo-Saxons, but according to Fairholt the example
given shows them to greater advantage than does
any other known. The figure in question is dressed
in royal costume, and the bandages, which are of
gold, are fastened just below the knee with a knot
from which hang tassels. (See Figure <a href="#fig071">71</a>.)</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span>&mdash;Leg bandages of a royal personage at the end

</div></div>

<p>It has been thought that leg bandages were originally
derived from the haybands which peasants
wrap round their legs, and the writer has seen it
stated that ostlers in this country still perpetuate the
Anglo-Saxon fashion, though he has never met with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
an actual instance. The pfiferari who some years
ago used to play on bagpipes and other primitive
instruments in our streets, wore leg bandages or
loose linen stockings, and these were cross-gartered
with bands which held in place a simple sandal made
of a piece of leather.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 12em;"><a id="fig072"></a>
<img src="images/fig072.png" width="119" height="198" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span>&mdash;A stocking with clocks.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The vestige in modern stockings to which allusion
has been made is very often present, and takes the
form of the ornament which we know as a &ldquo;clock.&rdquo;
The name signifies a gusset, and in modern socks
and so on, which are woven or knitted all in one
piece, no such arrangement is to be found. Stockings,
however, like those at first worn by Queen
Elizabeth, and used at least by American settlers until
the year 1675, were made up from pieces of cloth.
In these there would be seams down the sides, and
it is possible that where the ornamental lines meet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Figure <a href="#fig072">72</a> there may have been a gusset. In any
case, it is evident that the intention of the clock was
to hide the side seams.</p>

<p>Of recent years, when ladies have most sensibly
adopted short skirts, the clock has developed into a
series of embroidered patterns which cover the front
of the foot and ankle. The parentage of these is
quite evident from the shape, which is shown in
Figure <a href="#fig073">73</a>.</p>

<div class="container">

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span>&mdash;An open-work stocking

</div></div></div>

<p>This ornamentation has been carried still further,
though it is not produced in the same way. The
patterns, instead of being embroidered, are the result
of perforations, or, in more technical language,
&ldquo;open-work,&rdquo; and the background which shows up
the design is no longer the material of the stockings,
but the skin of their fair wearers. (See Figure <a href="#fig074">74</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>In many cases the stockings are dark in colour,
and the effect of tattooing is produced without the
preliminary pain and inconvenience. We have here
an instance of the way in which the specially human
instinct of decorating the body persists, and at the
same time a development of the fashion for displaying,
in the daytime under a thin veil of gauze or lace,
the necks and arms which since the time of our
grandmothers have only been allowed to appear uncovered
in the evening.</p>

<p>Leather stockings were once worn, for example, by
William Penn, and they and the leggings of to-day
may be a direct survival from the time when our
ancestors, though still wearing skins, had learnt to
dress them. Leggings, as such, are possibly connected
more closely with the protection of man
against man than with that of man against the
weather, and in that case their history is bound up
with that of armour. Gaiters, under the name of
spatter-dashes, were originally part of a soldier&rsquo;s
uniform. To-day, when worn by civilians in ordinary
dress, they are quite short, and go by the contracted
name of &ldquo;spats.&rdquo; Pedestrians still wear the full-sized
gaiters in conjunction with knickerbockers,
and white gaiters are a feature of Highland regiments.</p>

<p>Long Florentine hose, which practically took the
place of trousers and stockings together, are now
represented by what are called &ldquo;tights,&rdquo; and are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
be seen in the dress of acrobats. We shall allude to
these again.</p>

<p>Garters when visible on men&rsquo;s legs become very
ornamental, and one in use now, merely as a decoration,
gave its name to the celebrated Order of Knighthood,
among the insignia of which it is still to be
found. At the present day garters are hidden, and
there is a tendency for them to be replaced by more
comfortable straps or &ldquo;suspenders,&rdquo; but those which
ladies wear still retain their gaudy character. In this
connection an interesting ceremony may be mentioned,
which is carried out in Haute-Vienne on the
day of St. Eutropius. All the girls of the neighbourhood
troop to the church dedicated to the saint at
St. Junien-les-Gombes, and each damsel hangs her
left garter on the cross hard by, which becomes so
smothered with garters of different colours that when
seen from a short distance it looks as if it were
covered with flowers.</p>

PETTICOATS AND TROUSERS</h2>

<p class="srt2">THE BELTED PLAID AND KILT&mdash;EARLY SKIRTS&mdash;THE
ANTIQUITY OF TROUSERS&mdash;TROUSER STRIPES</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">We</span> were at some pains to trace the evolution of
the coat from the shawl, and it is possible
also to show that the petticoat, and through this
even trousers, have equal claims to the same ancestry.</p>

<p>The plaid as we saw it in Chapter III is only a
shawl, and at one time in Scotland it was used as a
covering for practically the whole of the person. It
was ingeniously disposed, and part of it was fastened
by a belt round the waist so as to form a kind of kilt
or petticoat. Hence arose the name of belted plaid.
It seems to have needed a considerable amount of
practice to put on this garment properly, and the
method customarily adopted by the wearer was to
spread the plaid on the ground and, after duly
arranging it in its proper folds, to lie down upon it
and fix it with the belt. Some races seem to have
recognized very much earlier that it would be more
convenient to separate the kilt from the upper garment.
In fact, if we examine the woven garments
which the Danish chieftain wore under his deer-skin
cloak, at a time before the use of iron had spread to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Western Europe, we find that round his loins he
had a small shawl held in place by a girdle. (See
Figure <a href="#fig075">75</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 15em;"><a id="fig075"></a>
<img src="images/fig075.png" width="148" height="247" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.</span>&mdash;A shawl used as a kilt by a chieftain of Denmark
in the bronze stage of culture (after Worsaae).</p>
</div></div>

<p>The next stage in the evolution of the petticoat
would be characterized by the permanent joining of
the edges of the cloth, so that a garment would be
formed which resembled the lower part of the tubular
tunic which played its part in the evolution of the
shirt or coat. Such a state of affairs is to be seen in
the simple skirt of the Danish chieftainess whose
bodice we have already described. (See page <a href="#Page_18">18</a>.)
Here the petticoat was not shaped in any way at the
top, but was gathered in round the waist and fastened
as in the case of the man with a girdle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;"><a id="fig076"></a>

Egyptian figure of the Sixth Dynasty (3500 <span class="f8">B.C.</span>), from
the Myers collection in Eton College Museum.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In a warm climate it would be easy to dispense
with a covering for the upper part of the body, and
one of the simplest dresses imaginable was adopted
in ancient Egypt. This costume is to be seen on
the figure of a woman belonging to the Sixth
Dynasty (3500 <span class="f8">B.C.</span>), which we have already mentioned
when tracing the development of the hat-band
and ribbons. (See Figure <a href="#fig045">45</a>.) In this instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
there is a simple tight-fitting skirt reaching to the
waist or a little above it, which is supported by two
straps passing between the bare breasts and over the
otherwise naked shoulders. (See Figure <a href="#fig076">76</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 15em;"><a id="fig077"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 77.</span>&mdash;A Korean servant (after Hough).</p>
</div></div>

<p>It seems certain, as in the original carving the
woman is shown with a burden on her head and in
the act of driving a calf before her, that she is a
representative of the peasant class. In the Korea at
the present day, women of the lower orders, although
they adopt a jacket which covers their arms and
shoulders, wear so short an one that as there is no
garment beneath it leaves their breasts quite bare.
(See Figure <a href="#fig077">77</a>.) Such an arrangement would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
obviously facilitate the nursing of children, and this
fact has been advanced as the reason for its adoption.
Still it may be merely a fashion such as some women,
at the other end of the social scale, once adopted in
our non-tropical country. In the time of James&nbsp;I of
England, the noble ladies, while they wore an exaggerated
ruff round their necks, nevertheless had
their dresses cut away from just below it almost to
their waists.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 15em;"><a id="fig078"></a>
<img src="images/fig078.png" width="176" height="303" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 78.</span>&mdash;A short kilt.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The short kilt now worn in Scotland represents the
lower part of the belted plaid, and is in fact a petticoat
and specially interesting, seeing that it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
survival of this type as a man&rsquo;s garment. Of the
origin of the sporran which is worn in front of the
kilt, little seems to be known, and though it recalls
to mind the time when men were clothed in skins, it
forms a pouch as well as an ornament, and possibly
also may have been useful as a protection. (See
Figure <a href="#fig078">78</a>.)</p>

<p>Having once derived the petticoat, however, from
the ancestral shawl, it is a very simple matter to proceed
and evolve a pair of trousers. As a matter of
fact, the Eastern women, when they fasten their petticoats
between their ankles for convenience in walking,
demonstrate the first stage in the production of bifurcated
garments.</p>

<p>A single row of stitches will give rise to a kind of
divided skirt, while two seams and a single cut made
between, and parallel, to them, will produce a pair of
trousers.</p>

<p>It would be strange if so simple a process, which
under many conditions results in such a great improvement,
had not been put into practice in very
early times, and trousers, although they seem to
typify the ugliness of modern costume, are in reality
surrounded by a halo of antiquity. It is only right,
however, to point out that these tubular garments
were in olden days not associated with the highest
civilization. The Romans, for instance, did not wear
trousers, though the nations whom they were pleased
to call barbarians, did. Some of the enemies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Rome are shown on Trajan&rsquo;s column wearing nether
garments of the kind most familiar to us, and our
illustration is taken from the representation of a
barbarian soldier carved on an ivory diptych of
St. Paul. (See Figure <a href="#fig079">79</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;"><a id="fig079"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 79.</span>&mdash;A barbarian soldier wearing characteristic trousers
(from a diptych of St. Paul, after Marriott).</p>
</div></div>

<p>The kilt is sometimes called the garb of old Gaul,
but one province of the latter owes its name&mdash;Gallia
Braccata&mdash;to the custom among its inhabitants of
wearing braccÃ¦ or breeches. In our own country
trousers were in vogue before the advent of the
Roman conquerors, and though for a time the dress
of the invaders was adopted by those who followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
their fashions, we find that in the time of the Saxons
and Normans the barbarian style found favour once
more.</p>

<p>In the picture of a Saxon fighting man (see Figure
<a href="#fig080">80</a>), we see that he wears trousers that somewhat
recall those of the modern sailor, and there seem to
have been many different styles even in those early
days.</p>

Harleian MS., No. 603, after Fairholt).</p>
</div></div>

<p>During the course of our history, long trousers
went out of fashion for a very considerable period,
though knee-breeches of various kinds flourished from
time to time, until recently, when the original and less
elegant garment once more triumphed and became
part of the everyday dress of men. Boys still wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
knickerbockers in one stage of their development,
intermediate between the doffing of the petticoat and
the donning of the trouser, and there is a tendency,
that does not diminish, for the shorter garments to
be used by men of all ages when they are not
occupied with formal business.</p>

<p>Trousers are often wrongly thought to be a modern
invention, and it is easy to go away with the idea
that they are exclusively the attributes of men. This
is far from being the case, and as in Scotland we find
the petticoat still in use by men, so in France and
Switzerland (see Figure <a href="#fig081">81</a>) we see the peasant
woman wearing trousers of the ordinary type, to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
nothing of Oriental countries like Persia and Siam
(see Plate <a href="#plate05">V</a>), where trousers form part of the dress
of women even of the highest rank.</p>

<p>We must not forget the energetic crusade which is
being carried on in this country in favour of &ldquo;rational
dress&rdquo; for women, on lines which are more sensible
than those laid down by Mrs. Bloomer, whose name
has been immortalized in connection with divided
garments for women. It is not intended, at the
moment, to enter into a discussion of the advantages
that may be gained by banishing the skirt, as we
shall consider clothes, from the point of view of their
effect upon the body, in a later chapter. Suffice it to
say that the ugly clothes worn a few years ago by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
lady bicyclists who, while adopting divided garments,
tried to make them look like a skirt, did much to
hinder the &ldquo;rational dress&rdquo; movement.</p>

<p>There is one vestige in connection with trousers that
we may mention before leaving this subject, and that
is the stripes which are to be seen on many official
dresses, and which have been adopted by some men
in their evening dress of recent years. It seems that
this takes us back to a row of buttons which were
once used along the whole length of the breeches
when these were too tight for the foot to be put
through them, and in consequence they had to be
undone and done up again along the side of the leg.
(See Figure <a href="#fig082">82</a>.)</p>

<p>There is little doubt but that the stripe represents
a fold of cloth that in some cases covered up these
buttons. Just a few of such buttons are still to be
seen on riding breeches and those worn by liveried
servants.</p>

COATS OF ARMS</h2>

<p class="srt2">SIGNET RINGS&mdash;ARMORIAL BEARINGS&mdash;ESCUTCHEONS&mdash;CRESTS&mdash;BADGES</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Before</span> we deal with coverings for the hand, it
will not be amiss to consider something else
which is worn on the fingers. Strictly speaking, of
course, rings should be reckoned as ornaments, but
signet rings very often bear upon them the crest or
coat of arms of their wearer, and thus we have still
carried on the person at the present day, a small and
inconspicuous vestige of what were once most important
articles of costume. In fact, they had a
significance as great if not greater than any others,
for when the face of their wearer was hidden by his
helmet, they told to those well versed in heraldry not
only his name but his lineage.</p>

<p>The crest was worn on the helmet, and might or
might not be one of the devices or charges embroidered
on the surcoat,&mdash;which was worn over the
armour&mdash;and emblazoned on the shield and elsewhere.</p>

<p>At the present day, except in the case of ceremonial
dress such as the tabards of heralds, the only survivals
are the crest and shield. The devices on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
latter are now called a coat of arms, as in olden
times they were, as already indicated, merely a repetition
of those actually worn on the dress or coat
armour.</p>

<p>Let us compare for a moment the first two figures
which illustrate this chapter. In the first (see Figure
<a href="#fig083">83</a>) we have a tiny device engraved on a ring that is
worn on the little finger of the left hand. In the
second (see Figure <a href="#fig084">84</a>) we have Sir Geoffrey Loutterell
mounted on his charger in the act of receiving
his helmet and shield from some of the ladies belonging
to his family. All of the figures and the horse
are decorated with armorial bearings. We wonder
whether there could be a greater contrast. The
knight has what is really his surcoat on his back displaying
six martlets with a bend between them. The
charges are repeated on a small square shield on his
shoulder called an ailette, which was used apparently
more as an ornament than as a protection, though it
is said that ailettes were originally intended as a
defence for the neck. Sir Geoffrey holds his helmet,
on which, in the place of the crest, we again see his
armorial bearings. They appear again on the pavon
or small flag held by one of the ladies, and on the
shield which the other carries. We find the same
devices repeated five times on the trappings of his
charger; and as if this were not enough, the ladies
also have the bearings on their dresses. In the case
of Lady Loutterell, who was the daughter of Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Richard Sutton, there is shown also the lion rampant
borne by her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>We give another illustration taken from the effigy
of Henry, the first Duke of Lancaster, on a brass at
Elsyng, in Norfolk. (See Figure <a href="#fig085">85</a>.) On this figure
the surcoat is very well shown, and on it are emblazoned
the three lions (or leopards) of the Royal
Arms of England. It is interesting, too, owing to
the label which differences the arms and shows that
the wearer was not the king himself. The label takes
the form of three vertical bars joined by a horizontal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
one, and is like that which may be seen to-day on
the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s banner in St. George&rsquo;s Chapel
at Windsor. In this illustration, too (Figure <a href="#fig085">85</a>), the
crest is very well shown.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Armorial bearings are still used to a considerable
extent in architecture, but otherwise they are chiefly
confined to notepaper, carriage panels, and harness.
Occasionally hatchments, or more properly achievements,
are put upon the fronts of the houses of important
people on the death of a member of the
family, and afterwards transferred to the church in
which the body is buried. The hatchment consists
of the arms of the deceased person, painted on a
lozenge-shaped field, which is surrounded by a black
frame, and if it indicates the death of a husband, the
right half of the field is sable (black), the left, argent
(silver). If it is a wife that is dead, the colours on
the field are reversed. When a widower, widow, or
unmarried person dies, the whole of the field is made
black.</p>

<p>In olden times the actual helmet, surcoat, and
shield were carried at the funeral, and in some instances
these were deposited over the tomb of the
deceased. Examples survive to the present day, and
one of the most interesting cases is to be found in
Canterbury Cathedral, where the shield, helmet, and
surcoat of Edward the Black Prince are still to be
seen. (See Figures <a href="#fig086">86</a>, <a href="#fig087">87</a>, and <a href="#fig088">88</a>.) The Black
Prince left most careful instructions in his will with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
regard to his funeral, and the accoutrements which we
are able to figure through the kindness of the Society
of Antiquaries, were the &ldquo;arms of war,&rdquo; as he called
them, that were to be carried at the ceremony. His
&ldquo;arms of peace&rdquo; consisted of his ostrich feather
badge, of which we shall again speak. There are
traces on the crest and surcoat of a label to distinguish
them, but this is absent from the shield, though it
occurs on the arms many times repeated on the tomb,
alternately with the feather badge already mentioned.</p>

<p>With the exception of the signet rings and the
ceremonial dress, which were alluded to at the beginning
of the chapter, there are now but few cases
where armorial bearings are worn on the person.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
School and college arms are embroidered on the
breast pockets of blazers and on the fronts of caps,
while perhaps the most common instances are the
devices which we see on the buttons of servants.
Whole coats of arms may appear, but usually it is
the crest of the master, which has now taken the
place of the household badge which the retainers
wore in olden times.</p>

<p>There is a difference generally between a crest and
a badge, though in some cases the badge was really
a crest. This was so before armorial bearings became
hereditary, for the badge which the knight wore on
his helmet formed its crest. Afterwards the same
device was handed down to generation from generation.
Individuals, possibly with a view of hiding
their identity, sometimes wore a special badge instead
of their family crest; but the badge as generally
understood was, as has already been indicated, worn
by the retainers and was usually chosen by each
head of the family. The matter is further complicated,
because badges were sometimes hereditary and
occasionally identical with the crest proper.</p>

<p>It is of course only the hereditary badges which
have survived to the present day, and in only one or
two cases are they apparently still used as such,
though occasionally they survive for other purposes.
The Prince of Wales&rsquo;s feathers we have already
mentioned. They were not adopted by the Black
Prince for the reasons usually given in history, as there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
is nothing to show that the King of the Bohemians
ever wore them, and long before his time an ostrich
feather was often used as a royal badge in England.</p>

<p>On his carriage, the Marquis of Abergavenny wears
his badges, a rose and a portcullis, one on each side
of his crest, and there are interesting cases here and
there of badges worn as part of a livery. The porters
of the Inner Temple wear the pascal lamb in silver.
Watermen still have badges on their arms, and not
very long ago the private firemen of the insurance
companies wore badges bearing the sign of the company.
When speaking of signs, it is worthy of note
that very many royal badges have furnished signs for
inns. We cannot go into details, but we may mention
the White Hart of Richard II, the Falcon and
Fetterlock of Henry&nbsp;VII, now degenerated into the
hawk and buckle, and the Rose and Crown also
used by the Tudors.</p>

<p>Those who chance to see the dress of our convicts
will hardly be inclined to associate it in any way with
that of royalty. Yet it is true, nevertheless, that the
broad arrow which marks&mdash;we can hardly say adorns&mdash;the
garments of the penitentiary, is in reality a royal
badge. The broad arrow can be traced to an ancient
symbol consisting of three converging rods or rays
of light used by the Druids, and it was adopted by
Edward&nbsp;III as his badge. The symbol was also
worn by the Black Prince and other Princes of
Wales. As early as the year 1386 the broad arrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
was used in the Royal household, and from the beginning
of the eighteenth century onwards it was adopted
as a mark for distinguishing Government stores.</p>

</div></div>

<p>We may conclude our remarks upon this fascinating
subject by alluding to a case in which a crest is
actually borne on the head. It will be seen on looking
at Figure <a href="#fig089">89</a>, which represents the postilion of a
Lord Mayor of London, that he wears upon his
jockey cap the actual crest of his master, in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
way that in the days of chivalry the knights wore
their crests upon their helmets. On his sleeve also
there is a full coat of arms with helmet and crest,
which takes the place of the badge, and is similar to
the instances which we have mentioned just above.</p>

GLOVES AND MITTENS</h2>

<p class="srt2">ORIGIN OF THE BABY&rsquo;S GLOVE&mdash;FOURCHETTES&mdash;THE
&ldquo;POINTS&rdquo; ON THE BACKS OF GLOVES</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Gloves</span> play a considerable part in our everyday
life, and now exercise a kind of mild
tyranny over us. It is perhaps not to be wondered
at, seeing the importance which has been attached to
these protectors of the hand in the past.</p>

<p>Records show that in the earliest gloves there were
no divisions between the fingers, and only the thumbs
had a separate covering. This is what one might
have expected to be the case, and if we look at the
gloves which tiny babies wear (see Figure <a href="#fig090">90</a>), we
shall find a similar state of affairs, so that here we
have a direct survival from very early times.</p>

<p>Such a case is on all fours with that of young
animals which belong to species that originally were
spotted like the leopard, but which in the course of
their evolution have changed their spots, and are now,
like the lion, self-coloured. Among other animals
which are spotted when immature may be mentioned
the wild boar and the tapir (see <a href="#plate01">Frontispiece</a>). While
these young ones are protected by their parents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
their primitive colouring is no detriment to them, but
when they go out into the world for themselves it
would be disadvantageous under existing conditions
for them to retain their aboriginal markings. In a
similar way the baby wears the primitive glove, which
its ancestors made shift to use for purposes of warmth
or protection, and the child continues to do so until
it is necessary or convenient for it to use its fingers
to help itself without removing its gloves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 18em;"><a id="fig090"></a>
<img src="images/fig090.png" width="108" height="177" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 90.</span>&mdash;A baby&rsquo;s glove without separate fingers.</p>
</div></div>

<p>There is little doubt but that gloves are the products
of a cold climate, and it is interesting to note
that in Iceland, where in order that gloves may be
put on quickly and easily they are made without
fingers; and what is more, so that no time shall
be wasted in choosing right or left-hand gloves, they
are provided with two thumbs, one of which is in use
while the other remains idle.</p>

<p>Of vestiges, gloves offer a very curious instance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
There are on the backs of most of them, at the present
day, three lines of raised embroidery or fancy stitching,
which run almost parallel with one another,
though they converge slightly as they approach the
wrist. When these are worked in black on the back
of a white woollen glove, for instance, they are very
conspicuous, and to explain their origin may well
seem puzzling. (See Figure <a href="#fig091">91</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 18em;"><a id="fig091"></a>
<img src="images/fig091.png" width="96" height="154" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.</span>&mdash;The back of a woollen glove showing the three
vestiges known as &ldquo;points.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>

<p>Inquiry into the history of these most persistent
ornaments is apt to produce a fine crop of speculations.
One explanation that may be offered is that
the lines are vestiges that date from the time when
gloves were so ill-fitting that they had to be laced up
the back with the help of a string which was passed
through eyelet holes. On hearing this one might be
tempted to ask why there should be three ornaments
and not one. Another guess which can be more
easily shown to be wrong is that we are dealing with
the remains of ventilation holes. We say &ldquo;more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
easily&rdquo; because an examination of the facts will show
that openings through which air was intended to
enter were made in the palm of the glove.</p>

<div class="container">

glove showing the stitching

Messrs. Fownes Brothers and Co.)</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>A third suggestion which may occur, is that the
ornamentation is a survival from the time when great
men, particularly prelates, had various devices and
even jewels fixed to the back of their gloves. Once
more, however, we meet with the difficulty in the
shape of the point that there are always three of the
marks.</p>

<p>In making a careful investigation into the true
origin of the vestiges we can, on the one side, endeavour
to see whether there is anything in the form
of the hand which can have given rise to the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
three, that is so constant; and on the other, whether
the glove-makers have any particular name for the
marks which may throw some light upon them. In
connection with the first line of research, it will be
seen on spreading out the fingers that there are, if
we ignore the thumb which has its insertion lower
down in the hand, three &ldquo;V&rdquo;-shaped openings
between them, and we find on taking up our second
clue that the ornaments are called &ldquo;points.&rdquo; Now
there is a point at the bottom of a &ldquo;V,&rdquo; and this is
well seen in looking at a glove where the pieces or
fourchettes which form the insides of the fingers meet
(see Figure <a href="#fig092">92</a>); but if this is evident in a modern
glove, it is very much more so in old gloves. (See
Figure <a href="#fig093">93</a>.)</p>

<p>A result of this fact was that the stitching which
made the fingers was carried down for some distance
on to the back of the glove, as seen in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s
coronation glove. (See Figure <a href="#fig093">93</a>.)</p>

<p>This stitching was and is often somewhat elaborate,
and in some cases a line of embroidery covered it.
This is well seen in the glove of Anne, the Queen
Consort of James&nbsp;I (see Figure <a href="#fig094">94</a>); and here it is
noticeable that the two lines of embroidery at the
points of the three &ldquo;V&rsquo;s&rdquo; run parallel and touching
each other, so that we get a beginning of the three
&ldquo;points&rdquo; as we know them. With improvements in
the making of the fourchettes, the stitching terminated
more abruptly, and the embroidery was allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
remain on the back of the glove, where it is still to
be seen.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Some mention should perhaps be made of mittens.
When they are used for the purpose of keeping the
hands warm, they are usually on the principle of a
baby&rsquo;s glove, but with the end of the thumb and part
of the bag for the fingers cut off. Otherwise, when
these articles are used merely to cover part of the
hands, or for ornament, they are more elaborate, and
divisions are introduced for some distance between
the fingers. In the construction of these, as in that
of stockings and other garments, we meet with the
modern tendency towards transparency. Often also
the patterns are dependent upon the skin showing
through, and we are once more reminded of tattooing.</p>

TAGS, PINS, AND BALDRICS</h2>

<p class="srt1">LACES&mdash;THE EVOLUTION AND VAGARIES OF THE SAFETY-PIN&mdash;PRIMITIVE
METHODS OF CARRYING BURDENS AS ILLUSTRATED
BY MUFF-CHAINS, BALDRICS, AND YOKES</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">During</span> the course of their evolution many
little appurtenances in connection with dress
go through a number of changes. Some of them,
which at first are useful, afterwards become ornamental.
Others, which have reached a stage in
which they are both necessary and decorative, may
for a time be simplified and retain a practical importance
only, while at a later period they resume
their ornamental character once more.</p>

<p>We have at the present day various laces which
are provided with simple metal tags, and which are
as primitive as they very well can be. (See Figure <a href="#fig095">95</a>.)</p>

<p>If we examine the dresses of both sexes in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, we shall find that
ties were used to a great extent instead of buttons,
and they were provided with metal tags of an ornamental
character called aiglets, or, more properly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
aiguillettes. In many cases the chief object of the
ribbons which they adorned was that of embellishment,
for as many as a dozen or more might be found
round one knee. Sometimes the tags were in the
form of little figures, and in the &ldquo;Taming of the
Shrew&rdquo; it is said of Petruchio that if you gave him
gold enough any one &ldquo;might marry him to a puppet
or an aglet-baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of recent years the velvet ribbons which ladies
have worn round their necks have been provided in
like manner with little tags (see Figure <a href="#fig096">96</a>), though
the fashion does not seem to have developed again to
any very great extent.</p>

<p>The safety-pin is an object which may well occupy
our attention for a moment. As we knew it when we
were children, it was merely a piece of wire that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
been pointed at one end and bent into the required
shape. (See Figure <a href="#fig097">97</a>.)</p>

<p>The point was protected in a very simple manner,

curtains are still constructed in the same way.
Occasionally gold safety-pins of a plain and even
ornamental character were made and used as brooches
by ladies for fastening lace, or by men for securing
their ties in the place of the straight scarf-pins. It
would seem therefore that a brooch is a development
of the safety-pin rather than the reverse; but if we
study the brooches or fibulÃ¦ of the Romans, we shall
find that the pin, instead of being hinged, was often
made in one piece with the rest of the structure. A
coil or two in the metal acted as a spring, as in the
case of the safety-pin, and prevented breakage. We
may even find an Etruscan fibula of such simple
construction (see Figure <a href="#fig098">98</a>) that it is to all intents
and purposes a safety-pin. All sorts of devices have
been invented for the better protection of the points
in modern safety-pins, as well as for rendering the
opening and closing more easy; but this is the
development which has taken place along practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
lines. Such pins are for use only, and are not intended
to be seen. When, on the other hand, safety-pins
are not hidden, they retain their more simple
character as regards their fastenings, though they
themselves again become decorative, and are ornamented
in various ways. We have therefore a very
good illustration of the evolution of one thing along
two different lines, and of the survival of the fittest
types in each case.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The ornamental safety-pin in recent years has
changed its habits, and it is interesting to note its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
vagaries. A little while ago its sphere of action was
extended, and instead of figuring under the chins of
ladies it took up a position in the back of their waistbands
(see Figure <a href="#fig099">99</a>), where it occupied itself with
the duty of keeping blouse and skirt together. Then,
as if this situation were not important enough, the
safety-pin migrated to the head and usurped the
place of the straight hat-pin (see Figure <a href="#fig100">100</a>), just as
in the case of men it has sometimes ousted the tie-pin
proper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;"><a id="fig099"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 99.</span>&mdash;The safety-pin in the waistband.</p>
</div></div>

<p>During the process which we have described the
safety-pin has become stronger and larger, until in the
last stage it has grown almost out of recognition.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;"><a id="fig100"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 100.</span>&mdash;The safety-pin grown larger and used for fastening on a hat.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Straight pins have developed along the same two
lines, and we have the strictly useful pin and tie- or
hat-pins, which are often quite as important as
fastenings, but which may also be highly ornamental.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
These small articles have a special claim to our
attention, as they have been taken as being emblematical
of clothes, or at least of female attire.
Even now the allowance which a lady is given for
dress is called &ldquo;pin-money.&rdquo; Moreover, it is possible
to illustrate by means of pins the various phases of
culture through which mankind has passed in the
process of civilization. We meet with pins of bone,
in the stage of stone, before metals were used. In
the stage characterized by bronze we have pins made
of this alloy. Such pins occurred in Egypt before
the historic period, and they have been found in the
Swiss lake dwellings as well as in our own country.</p>

<p>Although we now live in the iron, or perhaps
more correctly steel, stage of culture, the familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
pin of to-day is still usually made of brass; but
nevertheless we find steel pins of the ordinary form
which are plated with brass, and glass-headed steel
pins are very common. In early times also gold,
silver, and precious stones were pressed into service
for making ornamental pins, and very handsome pins
are represented on effigies of the fourteenth century
in Westminster Abbey. These, no doubt, have for
their descendants the scarf-pins of to-day.</p>

</div></div>

<p>A muff-chain is a thing which is very often seen at
the present day, and this simple arrangement, coupled
with the way in which it is worn (see Figure <a href="#fig101">101</a>),
may lead us along a very interesting line of research,
which we may follow for a short time. If we look
once again at the muff, we shall see that it is supported
by a chain which goes round the back of the
neck, allowing the muff to rest against the front of
the body. This is a primitive method of carrying a
burden. Pedlars of old made use of it, and it is still
adopted by the hawker (see Figure <a href="#fig102">102</a>), because, if
necessary, the hands can remain free, while a modification
of the same principle is seen when the strap
takes the form of a baldric, and passes over one
shoulder and under the arm on the other side. In
this way travellers carry their courier-bags (see Figure
<a href="#fig103">103</a>), the school-boy or girl supports his or her
satchel, the fisherman his creel, and the sportsman
his field-glasses. To a baldric also was attached the
quiver of the archer, and sometimes such a band was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a><br /><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
merely worn as a decoration. (See Figure <a href="#fig104">104</a>.) In
the illustration which we give, and which is of the
time of Henry&nbsp;V, the baldric is hung with bells like
those which were worn by horses. Possibly a survival
of the ornamental use of the baldric is to be
seen in the ribbons of various orders and in military
sashes, though no doubt the bandoleer which carries
the pouch or cartridges of a modern soldier represents
the useful baldric. It is of interest to note that the
red or blue cord worn over the cross-belts of the
Life Guards and Horse Guards is a survival of a cord
by which the horn containing powder for priming
muskets used to be suspended. In this connection
we might also mention the leather sling of a rifle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the strap by which the itinerant harpist, in common
with the organ-grinder, carries his instrument.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The ordinary belt should not be overlooked, as
from it many things, such as weapons, may be suspended,
not to mention pouches, which may carry
ammunition, flint and steel, and so on.</p>

and recalls a primitive method of carrying burdens.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Even more intimately connected with dress are
pockets, and they may be touched upon here, for they
are intended for carrying small objects. We have
seen how the flaps of pockets which have become
ornamental survive after the pockets themselves have
disappeared (see Figure <a href="#fig021">21</a>), and it is worthy of note
that clothes in various countries lend themselves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the transportation of commodities. It has been
pointed out by Mr. Otis T. Mason<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> that the Oriental,
especially the Korean, has pockets in his sleeves
having the capacity of half a bushel; while the Turk
and Arab can stow an equal amount in the ample
folds of their robes. The writer also remembers
hearing the account of a journey in Asia from a
traveller who, when riding in wide trousers fastened
at the ankle, used to keep all his clean linen in one
trouser-leg and his dirty clothes in the other.</p>

<p>We are reminded by the name given to the upper
part of a lady&rsquo;s dress, namely, the yoke (see Figure
<a href="#fig105">105</a>), of another means of carrying burdens, which
still survives in London, where a few milk-women
even now carry round their pails on a yoke. Their
costume, which includes a small shawl and an apron,
can be compared with that of the barge-girl, though
the picturesque sun-bonnet of the latter is lacking.</p>

ORNAMENTS</h2>

<p class="srt1">PRIMITIVE NECKLACES&mdash;FINGER-RINGS&mdash;THE ORIGIN OF THE
HAIR COMB&mdash;BUTTONS&mdash;STUDS&mdash;FLOWERS&mdash;FEATHERS&mdash;AMULETS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">We</span> have touched upon one or two objects which
may have a decorative character, but we now
come to a consideration of ornaments themselves.
Roughly speaking, they owe their survival to one
of two reasons: either the deep-rooted instinct which
exists in even the lowest races for adorning their
person, or, secondly, the adoption of various objects
which have been worn as charms or amulets.</p>

<p>Dr. E.&nbsp;B. Tylor<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> has pointed out the tendency
of higher civilization to give up savage ornaments.
Not the most primitive possibly, but seemingly the
most barbarous, are the ornaments which are fastened
into the body in special orifices which are pierced
to receive them. It is true that in this country we do
not make holes in our lips for the insertion of wooden
plugs two or three inches across, and the only nose
ornaments which we see are on the faces of the
Hindu ayahs who have come over from India with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
their white nurselings; but still many among the
population pierce their ears for the reception of earrings.
In the higher social ranks ear-drops are now
worn which do not require the ear to be perforated
for their reception; but among the lower orders&mdash;as,
for instance, those who live in canal-boats&mdash;the ears
of men, women, and children are still pierced.</p>

<p>Of ornaments which can be attached to the person
without injuring it there are more in use, but they
are practically confined in civilized countries to the
neck, arms, and head. Of those which are fastened
to clothes we will not for the moment speak. Beads,
which at the moment of writing seem to be greatly in
fashion, or their representatives, take us back to the
very earliest men of whose work we have any knowledge.
In the caves where the Stone Age men
of the mammoth period lived there have been found
periwinkle shells, which were bored to form bracelets
or necklaces, just as nowadays native tribes and
Ã¦sthetic ladies still make use of the more ornamental
and beautiful exotic shells. The prehistoric Egyptians
who, it has been calculated, flourished about 6000 <span class="f8">B.C.</span>,
had necklaces of beads cut out from pieces of shell,
and others made of many different materials. Among
the earliest remains in our own country beads are
found, and throughout the historic period everywhere
they seem to have held their sway.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned how easy it is for
ornaments to be used as currencies, owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
facility with which they may be carried on the person,
and beads for many centuries have been used&mdash;as in
Africa for instance&mdash;in the place of money. There
are on the west coast of that continent still to be
seen &ldquo;aggries&rdquo; similar to those which the Arab
traders brought with them from Egypt as early as
the seventeenth dynasty. At the present day beads
of various kinds&mdash;for only particular varieties will
buy certain commodities&mdash;are made and exported to
Africa to be used in trading.</p>

<p>While speaking of Egyptian beads, it might be said
that, as in other matters of art, the Egyptians excelled
in the making of beads. Some&mdash;known as blue popo
beads, which found their way to West Africa&mdash;are
worth more than their weight in gold at the present
day, and the most skilful of the Venetian beadmakers
are unable to imitate them sufficiently well to induce
the natives to accept them.</p>

<p>Chains for the neck in our time do not assume very
massive proportions, except those which are used as
symbols of office in the case of mayors and by the
members of various knightly orders. These take us
back to the time of Richard II, when such ornaments
came into vogue.</p>

<p>Among savage races metal rings find much favour
as ornaments, and they illustrate the fact that the
lady who wears the minimum of clothes will put up
with the height of inconvenience, not to say pain,
just as her over-dressed and more civilized white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
sister will do, in order to be in the height of fashion.
The Padaung women put metal collars round their
necks when they are young children till these number
between twenty and thirty, and the necks of the
wearers are stretched out in the most grotesque and
uncomfortable fashion. (See Plate <a href="#plate06">VI</a>.) African belles
will wear great copper rings on their limbs, which get
so hot in the sun that an attendant has to carry water
with which to occasionally cool them down. The
wearing of armlets and bracelets has never been confined
to women. Men among the Greeks did not
wear them, but among the Romans they did. Armlets
were conferred on soldiers for heroic deeds, and
even now the rank of non-commissioned officers in
the army is indicated by stripes on their sleeves.</p>

<p class="plate"><i>PLATE VI.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>Dr. Tylor hints that ordinary finger-rings have
originated from those used as signets in Egypt and
Babylon. In this case the modern signet ring, which
we have already discussed in connection with heraldic
devices, is a survival from the earliest times. Most
rings are now merely ornamental, though a few are
symbolical&mdash;the episcopal ring of the bishop, the
engagement ring of the betrothed damsel, and the
wedding ring of the wife.</p>

<p>As early as the seventh century a ring was among
the distinctive insignia of a bishop, and one was found
on the finger of Bishop Agilbert of Paris (who lived
at this time) when his coffin was opened. The ring
was of gold and, as is usual, had a jewel set in it, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
which, in the particular case mentioned, was a likeness
of Christ and of St. Jerome. The origin is no doubt
to be found in the fact that in Roman times rings
were used as an insignia of rank.</p>

<p>The episcopal ring proper was only one of many
other rings which a bishop might wear as ornaments.
It was borne on the third finger of the right hand,
above the second joint, and was usually kept in place
with a plain guard ring.</p>

<p>The Greeks and Romans used betrothal rings as
pledges, but not wedding rings. There is a good deal
of interesting symbolism in connection with rings, and
it is said that the third finger of the left hand was
chosen because in old times it was thought that a
vein came to that finger direct from the heart. The
practical point is that the finger in question is not
very much used, and on it the rings would not be so
liable to be worn out as on some of the others.</p>

<p>It is also supposed that the left hand was chosen as
it was the less important, and the wearing of a ring
on this hand signified servitude. An interesting form
of early wedding rings was that called the gimmal
ring, which consisted of two links, each having a hand
upon it, which when brought together formed a single
ring with the hands clasped together. The ring was
used at betrothal, and the man and woman each kept
a half until their wedding day. Perhaps the old
custom of breaking a coin upon engagement so that
each of the contracting parties may have half, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
relic of the same custom. In Ireland the peasantry
still use a ring, though a solid one, bearing clasped
hands. We have possibly a survival of the interesting
posey rings in those which bear the word Mizpah.
This originally signified &ldquo;a watch-tower,&rdquo; but it is
now taken as expressing the following sentiment:
&ldquo;God watch over thee and me when we are apart.&rdquo;
In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the couplet
or line was, as in the case mentioned, put on the outside
of the ring, while later, in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, the words were engraved inside
the ring. Occasionally we see a necktie held in place
with a ring, and this may well be connected with the
custom of wearing rings round the neck on a ribbon.
It is recorded that the Duke of Burgundy, who died
in 1476, carried his signet ring in this way.</p>

<p>A custom is still sometimes followed which dates
back to the sixteenth century. It is that of choosing
stones on account of the first letters of their names
and setting them in a ring in such an order that the
initials spell a word or words. For instance, the
following&mdash;Ruby, Emerald, Garnet, Amethyst, Ruby,
and Diamond, indicate <span class="f8">REGARD</span>; while a lover&rsquo;s exhortation
is produced by such a combination as Lapis-lazuli,
Opal, Verdi-antique, Emerald, Malachite,
Emerald.</p>

<p>Many of the Egyptian rings are made of blue
pottery or faÃ¯ence, and some of them show highly
ornamental and pierced work. The lotus flowers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
other figures upon them point to their being symbolical.
Others bear the sacred eye in the place where
the seal would be in a signet ring, and were probably
used as amulets; but of ornaments worn on account
of their supposed virtues we will speak in a moment.</p>

<p>An ornament for the head, with which we will deal,
is the crown. Mr. Elworthy, in a paper to the
British Association at Ipswich in 1895, derived the
crown from horns of honour. He maintained that
the symbols found on the head of the god Serapis
were the elements from which were formed the composite
head-dress called the crown, into which horns
entered to a very great extent. The panache in
heraldry is derived from the horn, and it may be
recalled that the deer-skin cloaks worn by the Bronze
Age people over the woven dresses that have been
described on pages <a href="#Page_18">18</a> and <a href="#Page_73">73</a>, bore the horns of the
animal from which they were taken.</p>

<p>Though the comb used as an ornament in the hair
is also worn on the head, it is on a very much lower
plane than the crown, and has presumably a very
much less exalted origin. Professor Boyd Dawkins<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
has expressed the opinion that the old loom comb
(see Fig. <a href="#fig106">106</a>), such as one found in the prehistoric
lake dwellings which have been excavated at Glastonbury,
is the ancestor of the comb worn as a head-dress
at the present day (see Fig. <a href="#fig107">107</a>). Combs were
used to push down the weft on a hand loom, the
warp being kept taut by means of weights. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
long hair-combs used by the natives of the West
Carolines are also of very much the same shape as
the old loom combs.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Already in the safety-pin and scarf-pin we have had
instances of fastenings which at times are ornamental.
The button and its relative the stud afford another
case in point. A stud is in reality a button which
appears on both sides of the stuff through which it is
put. It is obvious that it is most convenient to use
when the material to be fastened is of a stiff texture.
At present we use studs in our starched linen, and
they are also adopted for fastening parts of leather
accoutrements, as they evidently were in the times of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the later bronze folk. This will be seen from Figure
<a href="#fig108">108</a>. One of these is adorned with the triskele,
which is allied to the swastika, and no doubt gave
rise to the three-legged charge on the coat of arms of
the Isle of Man and of Sicily.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Buttons have from time to time done a great deal in
the way of decorating clothes, in addition to the part
which they have played as fastenings. We saw in an
earlier chapter how many of our buttons, which are
now only ornamental, were once of use, and any
history of costume which goes into details will show
how largely, superfluous buttons have figured as ornaments.
The older Quakers, of course, refused to wear
any buttons that were not needful, and brought down
upon them the criticisms of Cobbett, who referred to
other things which they lacked besides buttons.
Although at the present time we may be inclined to
appreciate some of our purposeless buttons, on
account of their historic associations, we cannot say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the same for many of those which now appear on
ladies&rsquo; dresses. There is little sense in having on the
front of a bodice a series of buttons of which the first
member is very large and the last very small, with the
others graduated in size between them, while there
seems to be no rhyme nor reason in many other
individual buttons or patches of them which are
dotted here and there over the costume. It is not as
if these additions were really handsome. Not long
ago they looked as if the wearer had saved up all her
old glove buttons, and then had sewed them to her
frock, for they were quite tiny and made of brass.
Now, though they are larger, they are merely covered
with the cloth of which the dress is made and are
usually quite plain.</p>

<p>In some cases buttons show great beauty of design,
and for this reason, if not on account of the material
of which they are made, may be exceedingly
valuable.</p>

<p>Bearing on the antiquity of buttons, we may say
that they are found among prehistoric remains in this
country, and though they were foreign to the ancient
Egyptians, we learn (through the kindness of Professor
Flinders Petrie) that engraved buttons or seals were
usual from the sixth to the nineteenth dynasty, probably
among foreign immigrants, for the designs are
never true Egyptian. In the present year, 1907,
Professor Petrie found a cornelian button with a
copper shank which belongs to the twelfth dynasty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The use of flowers, whether artificial or natural, on
the person, and more particularly the wearing of
feathers, also takes us back to the primitive instinct of
early or uncivilized man.</p>

<p>In our own country the custom of wearing feathers
is an exceedingly old one. The single upright
specimens worn by the knights of the fourteenth
century have been characterized as being preposterous
in size. The plumes afterwards worn in
helmets in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were
also immense. In 1606, according to Nichol&rsquo;s &ldquo;Progresses,&rdquo;
on the occasion of the visit of Christian&nbsp;IV,
some of the knights &ldquo;wore strange feathers of rich
and great esteem which they called Birdes of Paradice,&rdquo;
and, unfortunately, ladies of the present day
wear them still. In the reign of Edward&nbsp;IV, we
learn, only men, practically speaking, wore feathers.
They still survive in the army, but otherwise in the
twentieth century, with the exception of an occasional
small and modest instance amongst civilians, the wearing
of plumes is confined to ladies.</p>

<p>Many flowers and feathers are exceedingly beautiful,
and from an artistic point of view there seems
little reason why we should allow civilization to sweep
them away. We are quiet and colourless in our
clothing, and if we are not careful the same element
of dulness may creep into our lives. At the same
time, however, to wear feathers which can only be
obtained at the cost of cruelty or of depriving others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of the sight of beautiful birds, or, again, of bringing
any species to extinction, savours too much of barbarousness
and thoughtlessness to be in any way condoned.</p>

<p>Ostriches are reared for their feathers, and the
plumage of many birds that are killed for food is
always at hand.</p>

<p>Men have much less opportunity now of showing
any great individuality in their dress than heretofore,
but sometimes they may be known by always
wearing a buttonhole, even if that does not always
consist of the same kind of bloom. The language of
flowers, though now seemingly considered to be a
dead letter, was hardly invented for nothing.</p>

<p>Of the brooch and its connection with the safety-pin
we have already spoken. In many ornaments
we find remnants of religious ideas; for instance, all
brooches showing a crescent pattern or bearing the
design of a hand are connected with the old phallic
worship. The cross, it may be mentioned, is of much
more ancient origin than Christianity, and is connected
intimately with the swastika or fylfot.</p>

<p>The locket and other pendant ornaments must in
many, if not all, cases be the descendants of amulets.
The Arab women at the present day wear a little
metal box containing a written talisman. An ancient
Egyptian buried, with his mummies, many amulets
and charms so that the soul, in obedience to various
precepts, might enter into complete union with Ra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the solar god, and so accompany him on his journey
round the world, and secure his everlasting protection.</p>

<p>It is due to these ideas that we owe the beautifully
modelled figures of glazed pottery found in the
Egyptian tombs. Many of them depict the various
gods and goddesses acknowledged in Egypt, and
they are usually pierced for attachment to the person.
These were also carried on the person during life,
and children especially were accustomed to wear
them.</p>

<p>Old religious beliefs and superstitions that have
not yet died out, have elsewhere given rise to the
wearing of charms, and it is interesting to note that
flint arrow-heads, under the name of &ldquo;elves&rsquo; arrows,&rdquo;
were made into pendants by races who had reached
the metal stage of culture.</p>

<p>Precious stones, upon which a word may be said
here, no doubt at first were prized for their beauty
alone, and then imagination gradually endowed many
of them with fictitious properties and virtues, though
doubtless the supposed attributes of some and the
value and beauty of others have kept many precious
stones in favour until the present day. Fashion is
now particularly fickle as regards them, and craftsmen
who deal with gems, feel her decrees<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> more keenly
perhaps than any one else. Some half-dozen kinds
of stones&mdash;such as diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires,
opals, and turquoises&mdash;never go completely out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of fashion, but even among these, one or other
becomes paramount from time to time.</p>

<p>The topaz and chrysolite were reported to lose
their brilliancy when placed in liquid that contains
poison. To the amethyst was attributed the power
of warding off the effects of drunkenness. The
diamond, it was believed, gave to the wearers magnanimity,
virtue, and courage. The ancients supposed
that the opal shared the charm of every stone
of which it reflected the colour, but when it was
stolen, the thief became invisible, and was allowed to
escape scot free. Mr. Claremont<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> has made an interesting
suggestion as to the reason why the opal has been
considered unlucky. The notion, he says, is not
nearly so ancient as many of the superstitions relating
to other stones, and probably does not date further
back than the Middle Ages. The old name &ldquo;ophal&rdquo;
was used as late as the time of Queen Elizabeth, and
came from the Greek for &ldquo;eye&rdquo;-stone, and as eyes
are unlucky even in peacocks&rsquo; feathers, perhaps the
explanation of the superstition lies in the name of the
stone.</p>

<p>Such walking-sticks as those garnished with
&ldquo;sylver&rdquo; and &ldquo;golde,&rdquo; which are described as being
at the Royal Palace at Greenwich in the reign of
Henry&nbsp;VIII, may well be considered as ornaments.
The same may be said of the be-ribboned canes of
the exquisites of Charles&nbsp;II&rsquo;s and later times. We
mention them because, within the last two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
years, there has been a talk of seeing &ldquo;the nice conduct
of a clouded cane&rdquo; more generally considered,
and some men have appeared at the theatre with
long, gold-knobbed and tasselled canes.</p>

<p>The buckle, which may be ornamental or useful,
or both, is well worthy of our attention. It
consists in its simple form of a ring and a pin, and
the latter is hinged on to the former. It is, in fact,
much like a brooch, but without a hasp, and used in
a different way. There are brooches, however, at
the present day, which are even simpler in construction
than the buckle, and they are used<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> even now
by blacksmiths in Kirkudbrightshire, in the form of
the iron ring and a horseshoe nail, with which they
fasten their aprons. Similar pin-ring brooches were
used in Ireland until quite recently and are known
from early times. Mr. Edward Lovett<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> thinks that
such a fastening may well have been derived from
two bones of the sheep or deer, the garment being
pulled through the ring formed by half the hip
girdle, and speared through with the pointed heel
bone.</p>

<p>A still more primitive pin was no doubt a thorn,
and fish-hooks are to this day used on the coasts of
Essex, which are made from the same natural object.</p>

HAIR DRESSING</h2>

<p class="srt2">HEAD SHAVING&mdash;WIGS THAT ARE STILL WORN&mdash;ROMAN
CURLS AND FRINGES</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> styles in which hair is dressed are so intimately
connected with fashions in costume that
no excuse is needed for dealing with the question
here. Moreover, there are certain vestiges in costume
occasionally to be met with which owe their
origin to the way in which hair was once arranged.
Hair can be treated in all sorts of manners without
injuring the person in any way, and usually without
causing pain, though some fashions in hair arrangement
had results that were far from pleasant, and
must have caused considerable discomfort.</p>

<p>In addition to the styles in which hair is allowed to
grow, there are others which lead to its removal from
one or more of the places which it normally covers,
and almost every change that could be rung is met
with. In addition to the hair on the head, women
have only their eyebrows and eyelashes to consider,
though it is the fashion to remove any &ldquo;superfluous&rdquo;
hair from their faces and arms. Men have also to
consider moustaches, whiskers, and beard. Nowadays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
it is decreed that women&rsquo;s hair should be long
and that men&rsquo;s should be short; but even now men
with long hair do not necessarily look effeminate,
as is shown by the cowboys from the Wild West
who have taken part in various exhibitions in this
country, and whose hair reaches on to their shoulders.
The shaving of the whole head is carried out by
many savage nations, and this is perhaps surprising,
seeing that the process cannot but be laborious and
even painful when carried out with flint knives or
pieces of shell. The Chinese leave the hair that
grows from one small spot in order to make their
pigtail.</p>

<p>In this country it might be thought that the tonsure
of priests was the only remnant of shaving the head;
but we need go no farther than the East End of
London to find Jewesses who upon marriage shave
their head and put on wigs. It appears that the
custom is still universal in the remote villages of
Russia, where every Jewess on her marriage shaves
her head. The wig that is worn is of a very plain
pattern, and the hair of which it is composed is parted
down the middle. The object which seems to underlie
the custom is the destruction of the charm of the
women when once they have found husbands. In
London the younger women do not seem to be keeping
up the practice, and it is mostly in the case of
those who are over forty years of age that shaved
heads and wigs are to be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>There may be, however, another explanation. In
many countries where great value was attached to a
profuse head of hair a variety of superstitions arose,
and emblematic observances were followed with
regard to it. Parents dedicated the hair of their
infants to gods, as did young women theirs at their
marriage, warriors after a successful campaign, and
sailors after deliverance from a storm. The Egyptians
of all classes, as well as their slaves, shaved their
heads and wore wigs. By this habit they ensured
greater cleanliness, and the structure of the wig not
only allowed the heat from the head to escape, but
protected the latter effectively from the sun.</p>

<p>It does not happen that both sexes always follow
the practice of shaving their heads, for, contrary to
what prevails amongst civilized nations, Fijian women
are usually closely cropped, while the men spend
much time and attention on cultivating and elaborately
arranging a luxuriant mass of hair.</p>

<p>The tendency nowadays is to cultivate eyebrows
and eyelashes, but if we go back in our history to the
reign of Richard II we find that it was thought necessary
to pull out the eyebrows, and at the present day
in some parts of Africa it is one of the requirements
of female beauty to eradicate the eyebrows. Special
pinchers for this purpose are to be found among the
appliances of the native toilet. A man may of course
remove all the hair, speaking in the ordinary way,
from his face, or he may retain only his moustache or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
his whiskers or his beard, or a combination of any two
of these. At the present day we meet with all sorts
of styles, though one may be the fashion for the
moment among the younger generation or those who
wish to be considered smart. One cannot alter the
disposition of one&rsquo;s hair as easily as one can change
one&rsquo;s clothes, and this, perhaps, taken in conjunction
with the objection to change on the part of a man and
his relatives, gives the variety that has been mentioned.
For instance, if it were customary when a
man was young for his fellows to wear beards or only
a moustache, then he continues to wear a beard or
only a moustache.</p>

<p>Perhaps no other fashions come round again more
regularly than those which govern the amount of hair
on a man&rsquo;s face, and it may be interesting to indicate
very briefly some of the changes which have taken
place during the last two thousand years or so in this
country.</p>

<p class="just"><span class="smcap">Methods of hairdressing illustrated by Romano-Egyptian
portrait models in the Myers Collection, Eton College
Museum.</span></p>

<p>(<i>Photographs by Wilfred Mark Webb</i>.)</p>

<p class="right">(<i>See pages <a href="#Page_129">129</a> and <a href="#Page_133">133</a>.</i>)</p>

<p class="plate"><i>PLATE VII.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The inhabitants of England at the time of the
Roman invasion either did not shave at all or wore
only a moustache. The Romans often cut their
beards (see Plate <a href="#plate07">VII</a>, Figure <span class="f8">F</span>.), and the Saxons
parted their beards into double locks or neatly trimmed
them. When the Normans came into this country
they were closely shaved, but afterwards they went to
the opposite extreme.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century old men wore beards and
the younger generation shaved. Edward&nbsp;III had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
a long beard, Edward&nbsp;II two small tufts on his chin,
and in Edward&nbsp;IV&rsquo;s time the beard was closely shaven.
Afterwards we find that a tax was put on beards, and
once more, in Elizabeth&rsquo;s and the following reigns,
we have a number of extraordinary fashions in connection
with the hair on the chin. When we get to
1798, among the upper classes beards were again no
longer worn, and there have been several changes
since that time.</p>

<p>Apart from the prevailing fashion, there is, under
the conditions which we have seen to govern the
matter, considerable scope for the indulgence of
individual taste, and often an effect is produced which
is much more striking than otherwise would be the
case. A man may choose, for instance, to grow a
large pair of bushy whiskers, and he may thereby
give character and importance to his face, which
without them would be very insignificant. Curly
hair is effective and has its advantages, therefore we
find that it is carefully imitated both in the case of
real hair and of wigs. The effect is now usually
produced artificially only in connection with ladies&rsquo;
hair. When dealing with this branch of the subject,
once more we might allude to the monstrous
toilets which have been built up in defiance of all
laws of proportion and, we might add, of comfort
and cleanliness also.</p>

<p>To utilize the hair from the heads of others is an
ancient practice still to be met with, and all sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
means for making the most of one&rsquo;s own hair in the
shape of pads and so on are still adopted.</p>

<p>When speaking of footmen, we shall find that
those who dress in the costume that was in
fashion when hair powder was in vogue still wear
it, and the custom has been traced to the days
of Rome, when gold dust was put upon the head.
It has been suggested that our Saxon forerunners
used coloured hair powder or else dyed their hair,
but the evidence comes from Saxon drawings in
which the hair is often painted blue, and this may
be due merely to the caprice of the artist. It is
well to be wary also in studying the colour of clothes
at early periods, by looking at pictures, to remember
that the illuminators may have followed their own
fancy, and made garments of such colours as fitted
in with their own ideas of ornament.</p>

<p>Though the use of wigs is extremely ancient, the
origin, which is customarily ascribed to the peruke, is
interesting. Many curious fashions have arisen
through royal peculiarities or temporary indispositions,
the courtiers having imitated their royal master
or mistress, out of compliment. Louis&nbsp;XIV had,
when a child, remarkably beautiful hair, which fell in
curls on to his shoulders, and to imitate this, his
courtiers put on false hair, while later in life the king
himself adopted the fashion which they had set.</p>

<p>The obvious use of artificial additions to the hair has
now been discontinued for very many years except in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
a few cases. Judges and barristers with a few Parliamentary
and other officials still wear wigs, as do also
certain coachmen and footmen, but these we shall
consider elsewhere.</p>

<p>It will prove of no small interest after recalling the
various modes of doing the hair which ladies have
adopted during the last twenty or thirty years, to
compare them with the fashions in Egypt in Roman
times about two hundred years before the Christian
era.</p>

<p>The reason why we can do this so well is that the
Romano-Egyptians put on the top of their coffins
a model of the head of the person who was buried in
it. Professor Flinders Petrie has shown that the
effigies were really portraits, and even a glance at
some of them would go far to prove the statement.
Professor Petrie made composite photographs of the
face on the outside of the coffin and of the skull
within, and both in the profile as well as in the full-face
pictures it was seen that the plaster model
clothed the skull, as it were, with flesh.</p>

<p>To return to the question of hair dressing, if one
examines Plate <a href="#plate07">VII</a> we shall see first of all a lady
with corkscrew curls, which were more prevalent in
the last century than they are now, though they have
not yet died out. Then we have a lady with a very
elaborate fringe, another who allows her hair to fall
in waves on her forehead, and it forms a chignon at
the back. Lastly (Plate <a href="#plate07">VII</a>, Figure <span class="f8">B</span>) a little girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with a small bun on the top of her head. Another
specimen, not figured here, and also contained in the
celebrated Myers Collection, shows the bun exactly
as it was worn at the end of the last century.</p>

<p>We have included two heads (Plate <a href="#plate07">VII</a>, Figures <span class="f8">A</span>
and <span class="f8">F</span>), one of a boy and the other of a man, showing
the great likeness that exists between the way in
which hair was done more than two thousand years
ago and at the present day.</p>

<p>Besides the methods of hair arrangement which
have survived or been revived, there are certain
little features still to be seen here and there in modern
dress which owe their origin to the ways in which
hair or wigs were dressed.</p>

<p>A remnant of the bag-wig, with its great bow of
black ribbon, we may find in the army. For a long
time on the backs of the collars of the officers and
staff-sergeants of the Welsh Fusiliers there have been
fixed some ribbons which hang down their back.
These, which are few in number, are called the
&ldquo;flash,&rdquo; and are said to represent the bow which
used to ornament the bag-wig. A hundred years ago
the officers of the regiment wore their hair turned up
behind, and it was then tied with a bow. This is in
keeping with another explanation which Mr. R. Simkin
has given us, which is that the flash is the survival
of a bunch of ribbons that were sewn on the back of
the coat-collar to protect it from the pomatum and
powder of the &ldquo;clubbed&rdquo; or &ldquo;queued&rdquo; hair. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
privilege of wearing the &ldquo;flash&rdquo; has recently been extended
to all ranks of the regiment (see Figure <a href="#fig109">109</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 109.</span>&mdash;The &ldquo;flash&rdquo; of five black ribbons on the collar of the
Welsh Fusiliers. A survival from the days of the pigtail.</p>
</div></div>

<p>A survival of the same kind, which takes us back to
the time of wigs, is to be seen on the backs of the
collars of several court dresses, and it is known technically
as the &ldquo;wig-bag.&rdquo; It is also, as we have had
occasion to mention, to be seen on the back of the
collar of the liveries of some servants whose dress is
in the old style, and here, as in the case of the Lord
Mayor&rsquo;s coachman, it looks as if it had originated in
a bow (see Figure <a href="#fig113">113</a>).</p>

SPECIAL DRESSES</h2>

<p class="srt2">FASHIONS KEPT UP BY CEREMONIES&mdash;SURVIVALS IN
SPECIAL COSTUME&mdash;FLOWING GARMENTS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> the foregoing pages we have been concerned
chiefly with individual parts of costume, and
while showing how various garments have reached
their present form, we have busied ourselves with discovering
the origin of many important survivals. We
have not however hesitated, in dealing with these
details, to touch on all kinds of costumes, and here
and there we have left civilians&rsquo; dress for a moment
to take an illustration from that of the soldier or the
member of some other profession.</p>

<p>At the same time, we have indicated that on
occasions of ceremony, whether religious or otherwise,
the dress adopted is, as a rule, more primitive
or older in style than that which is customarily worn.
This is what might be expected, as, on the one hand,
innate conservatism and objection to change come
into play, and, on the other, ordinary everyday
practical matters being for the time put on one side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
it is possible to wear clothes which otherwise would
be inconvenient and liable to get damaged.</p>

<p>When we ourselves dress for dinner we go back
nearly a century, but nothing could be more primitive
than the Court etiquette of certain tribes,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> where the
subjects of the king may only approach him when
entirely unclothed. Livingstone was received by the
Queen of the Balonde Negroes in South Africa when
she was in a state of complete nudity. The women
of neighbouring tribes and members of other races,
for instance those in Australia, entirely remove their
clothing on festive occasions.</p>

<p>Among some black races, also, the girls who are
sent as official messengers to important persons are
not clothed. There are still certain tribes of &ldquo;leaf
wearers&rdquo; in India, while at a yearly festival in
Madras the whole low-caste population throw off
their ordinary clothing and put on aprons of leafy
twigs. Another case in point is that of the priests
who conducted the sacrifices in ancient Italy and
Greece, for they are often represented on monuments
as being naked, while the rest of those present at the
ceremony are fully clothed.</p>

<p>In taking up the question of ceremonial dress
among civilized peoples, we find that we have a very
wide field in which to wander. We have the Court,
which might alone occupy our whole attention; we
have naval, military, ecclesiastical, and legal dress,
the garb of the universities, the costume of pantomime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
characters, of the acrobat, of the athlete, and
the liveries of servants, besides the costumes adopted
for special ceremonies and in connection with particular
institutions. In treating of survivals in the
case of the army, where the variety in uniform&mdash;if
we may use this paradoxical expression&mdash;is so great,
we may content ourselves with discussing matters in a
way similar to that which we have adopted before.
On the other hand, we may also describe and illustrate
particular costumes, as a whole, while showing how
far their history may carry us back.</p>

<p>In addition to the clothes actually worn by persons,
there are those which are found on dolls. These
may be on the representations of personages such as
St. Nicholas, on the Continent and elsewhere, and
they are interesting because in many cases they may
show a national costume which is no longer worn. In
the same way, puppets such as are used in the play
which we know as Punch and Judy, and their
dresses, like others which we have studied, may bring
to our notice chapters of history in a way that is
exceedingly attractive.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that long flowing garments
produce a more elegant effect, and give rise to a more
stately appearance than those which are short or tight
fitting. In the case of men, such garments would
now be too much in the way on ordinary occasions, or
when any physical exertion is required. The king
and noblemen on state occasions wear robes, as do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
also the members of City companies and borough
councillors when they assemble together. The case
of the clergy will occur to every one, and legal and
academical dress may also be mentioned.</p>

<p>In the privacy of the home it is possible for every
man to wear a dressing-gown, and pyjamas have not
in all cases superseded the more primitive nightshirt.
In the case of ladies, we find that they cling lovingly
to long dresses, though, as we know, there is much
effort being made to dispense with skirts under
ordinary conditions, and the fact that short skirts
have for some years been fashionable for outdoor use
looks as if some progress were being made.</p>

SERVANTS&rsquo; DRESS</h2>

<p class="srt1">THE PROTOTYPES OF LIVERIES&mdash;REMINISCENCES OF GEORGE&nbsp;II
AND GEORGE&nbsp;III&mdash;ORIGIN OF THE PAGE-BOY&rsquo;S BUTTONS&mdash;THE
JOCKEY CAP&mdash;APRONS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> taking up the question of special costumes, we
may perhaps begin with those which we see most
commonly, and for that reason we may turn our
attention, in the first place, to the liveries and dress of
servants.</p>

<p>We have laid down a sort of rule that the costume
of servants is that of the master of an earlier generation,
and we will now bring forward some evidence
in support of it.</p>

<p>Modern coachmen and outdoor footmen wear the
tall hat, the bright buttons, doeskin breeches and the
top boots characteristic of the outdoor and riding
dress of the gentlemen at the beginning of the nineteenth
century. The groom, it will be noticed (see
Figure <a href="#fig110">110</a>), wears in addition a leather belt, and the
reason for this will not perhaps strike the inquirer
straight away. Our grandmothers and great-grandmothers
did not always drive in carriages, and it was
customary for them, when riding on horseback, to sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
on a pillion behind a gentleman or a servant. The
belt which we now see round the waist of a groom
afforded a hold to which they had to cling, in order to
prevent themselves from falling off the horse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;"><a id="fig110"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 110.</span>&mdash;The modern groom, showing the belt to which ladies
clung when riding on a pillion.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Such a livery as we have described is also adopted
by the general run of well-to-do people. The aristocracy,
however, are more inclined to stand upon
ceremony, and through it to make more show. Their
footmen, who go by the generic name of &ldquo;Jeames,&rdquo;
wear plush breeches, silk stockings, and powdered
hair. (See Figure <a href="#fig111">111</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

His &ldquo;pouter&rdquo; coat dates from the reign of George&nbsp;III.

</div></div>

<p>A little inquiry will soon show that these peculiarities
of dress were those which it pleased the gentlemen
of George&nbsp;III&rsquo;s time to adopt. Some flunkeys belonging
to the nobility have their breasts ornamented
with cords known as aiguillettes, and these give them
somewhat of a military appearance, besides reminding
us of the old retainers. The coats that go with the
plush breeches and are cut away so as to recall the
wings of a pigeon&mdash;hence the name &ldquo;pouter&rdquo; coat&mdash;are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
a special feature of George&nbsp;III&rsquo;s reign. The coachman&rsquo;s
coat is usually a little fuller in the skirt, and
carries us back to the time of George&nbsp;II. In another
way this costume is a little older in its style than that
of the footman who powders his own hair instead of
wearing a wig like his colleague. (See Figure <a href="#fig112">112</a>.)</p>

</div></div>

<p>In connection with the Lord Mayor more ceremony
still is maintained. His coachmen and footmen
appear in all the glory of three-cornered hats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
which are decorated with feathers, and their coats are
highly ornamented. They are representatives of the
very fine gentlemen of George&nbsp;III&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p>On the back of the collar of the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
coachman, we find an arrangement that looks like an
elaborately made rosette of black ribbon (see Figure
<a href="#fig113">113</a>). This is a survival of the bag-wig, of which we
shall have occasion to speak again when dealing
with Court and military dress, so that we need not go
into further details here with regard to this curious
vestige. (See page <a href="#Page_229">229</a>, Figure <a href="#fig143">143</a>.)</p>

</div></div>

<p>This is a progressive age, in spite of the many
survivals which still flourish, and when we come to
consider the costume of the modern manservant who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
attends at table, or the waiter in the restaurant, we
find that he has come out of his generation, as it
were, and has adopted the dress of his masters
before they have themselves discarded it. Confusion
has arisen through this before now, and it has been
suggested that if ornamental buttons were worn by
the man who serves, the difficulty would be overcome.</p>

<p>The writer well remembers being amused when
standing in a room at a well-known restaurant, where
a private dinner was to be given, to notice the change
which suddenly came over the dress of the waiters.
When the latter first arrived they had black cloth
buttons on their coats, while in a few minutes&rsquo; time,
these same garments were adorned with brass buttons
bearing the initials of the firm that provided the
dinner. Inquiry soon elicited the fact that the men
carried with them small brass cases which were
sprung on to their ordinary buttons, and at once gave
them the appearance of being on the staff, and
showed that they were waiters.</p>

<p>The almost overwhelming number of buttons which
are worn by page-boys must have been a source of
wonder to many. They run from neck to waist of a
tight-fitting jacket in such a crowded line that the
pages usually go by the name of &ldquo;Buttons.&rdquo; Occasionally
we see the livery ornamented by two other
rows of buttons which are useless, and run from the
shoulder towards the waist (see Figure <a href="#fig114">114</a>) in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
way similar to that described as being the case on the
coats of His Majesty&rsquo;s postilions. On looking at an
old book<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> of fashions we find that a costume called
the &ldquo;Dutch Skeleton Dress&rdquo; was very fashionable
for young boys in 1826 (see Figure <a href="#fig115">115</a>). In this we
find that there were brass buttons arranged in three
rows, similar to those we have just described. It is
difficult even in the modern page-boy&rsquo;s dress to see
the lower edge of his coat, but in the case of the
small boy of 1826 it was impossible, because his
trousers were buttoned on to the outside of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 115.</span>&mdash;The Dutch skeleton dress,

</div></div></div>

<p>The name of the skeleton dress is interesting,
because it points to the buttons marking out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
position of the breast bone, and it recalls the story that
the lacing on the breast of Hussars, which we have
interpreted as representing enlarged buttonholes, was
intended to give the appearance of ribs. This would
be in keeping with the figure of a skull that was worn
by some of them on their head-dress. We may imagine
that in the page-boys, with the superabundance
of buttons in one row, that the other two series have
migrated and joined with those which originally
fastened the coat.</p>

<p>On special occasions such as weddings and coronations,
the nobility and members of old families dress
their servants in state liveries, and some very interesting
costumes appear for the time. For instance, at
the wedding of the Duke of Norfolk in 1877, some
of the coachmen and footmen appeared wearing on the
shoulder of their livery a &ldquo;manche&rdquo; or large hanging
sleeve, which is familiar to students of heraldry and
may be the origin of the sign usually called the
&ldquo;Crooked Billet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An interesting little survival is sometimes seen on
livery collars. It is a little patch of lace, and is an
imitation of the knotched buttonhole or laced hole
which was commonly made on elaborate dresses.</p>

<p>We get a survival of a livery cap, which was worn
by servants generally in the middle of the eighteenth
century, in the black cap worn by the drum-major
of the Foot Guards and the bands of the Household
Cavalry. We find that it is also adopted by huntsmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and postilions (see Figure <a href="#fig089">89</a>), while jockey caps
are of a similar shape.</p>

<p>The costume of jockeys is an instance of parti-coloured
dress which, apart from the Stage, is now
chiefly worn in connection with sports such as football
and racing. Some parti-coloured garments
made their appearance early in English history,
as we shall see when dealing with the subject of
patterns.</p>

<p>The cockade is now a particular feature of the
liveried servant, and as the story of its evolution is
of a particularly striking nature, we will consider it
in a special chapter.</p>

<p>Here and there we find survivals of the old beadle,
with his three-cornered hat and his long gown with
its curious capes and its bright edging. To find the
original wearer of such garments we shall have to
look about at the end of the seventeenth century.
The watch then wore very large coats with many
capes, and from these was developed that of the
beadle. No doubt colours and other ornamentation
were produced so as to bring the dress of the beadle
more into the line with liveries and to give him a
more ornamental and imposing appearance.</p>

<p>We might also mention that the beadle, to whom
we shall once more allude, still makes his appearance
and plays his part in the Punch and Judy
show.</p>

<p>When we recall the many and varied liveries which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the porters belonging to the various places of amusement
and business establishments now wear, we
cannot help drawing attention to the magnitude of
the problem which would confront any one who desired
to trace the origin of their clothes. In one
detail or another we see the remains of an old livery,
while turning from these we find a gaily coloured
plastron borrowed from a Hussar uniform, and besides
the cap there are a host of other features
which have been taken from military and civilian
dress.</p>

<p>Railway porters if not menials are the servants of
the companies which employ them, and there is one
feature of their dress which is worthy of note. It
will be seen that their waistcoats, although generally
built on the same plan as that of the ordinary individual
and having a linen back, are provided with
sleeves. It is truly a coat which comes to the waist,
such as we shall speak of when dealing with the dress
of the Guards and other regiments, and it is usually
the outermost garment of the porter.</p>

<p>If we now turn to the costume of the gentleman,
we shall find a very good instance of what Mr. Paley
Baildon claims to be done whenever a new garment
is adopted. He says that it is always put on over all
the others. In the case of the ordinary civilian we
have the waistcoat, which was originally an outer
garment. Then comes the frock-coat or surtout,
which at the beginning of the nineteenth century was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
an overcoat, and over this again in cold weather the
modern ulster or top-coat is put.</p>

<p>No consideration of servants&rsquo; dress would be complete
without an allusion to the cap and apron of the
house- or parlour-maid. To begin with, we see in
these a survival of the special dresses which were
once adopted by particular trades. The fact that
the cap is white points to a connection with the early
head-dresses of women which we see now perpetuated
by the nuns, and which are relics of the time
when it was customary to have linen caps and hoods.
Perhaps there is some connection between the cap of
the servant and the custom which condemns women
to wear their hats in church and makes them feel
desirous of keeping them on their heads at all kinds
of public entertainments. On this question, however,
we shall have a word to say later.</p>

<p>Sometimes servants&rsquo; caps have strings which, like
those that are customarily found on bonnets and on
mitres (see page <a href="#Page_54">54</a>), are the survival of the ends of a
head fillet. The latest development in this direction
is a scarf which is allowed to hang down from the
backs of ladies&rsquo; hats, and which may be of so substantial
a nature that it looks very much like a fringed
towel.</p>

<p>The apron can claim a long history, and just as the
plush and powder of the footman were once worn by
his master, so we may easily discover that the apron
was not always the special attribute of those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
work or serve. Towards the end of the seventeenth
century aprons were considered an almost essential
part of a fine lady&rsquo;s costume. A little later on, Queen
Anne made and wore them herself, and very gaily
ornamented garments they were.</p>

<p>In the case of the lower classes, aprons were&mdash;as
they still often are&mdash;provided with bibs. The old
name for them was barme-cloth, and under this title
Chaucer refers to the apron of Carpenter&rsquo;s wife as
being as white as the morning milk. Unless the
article of dress which we are discussing was of considerable
age, we should hardly have the proverbial
expression which defines a man who is always at
home as being tied to his wife&rsquo;s apron-strings.</p>

<p>Another name for an apron with a bib which was
pinned to the front of the dress was &ldquo;pinner,&rdquo; which
gives us the word pinafore, which refers now to a
kind of overall rather than to an apron.</p>

<p>In the costumes of the barge-women and milk-women,
where we get a slight survival of characteristic
country dress, we have seen that in both
cases the apron is always adopted as part of the
outfit. (See Plate <a href="#plate08">VIII</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a id="plate08"></a>

<p>(<i>From a photograph by Wakefield, Brentford.</i>)</p>

<p class="plate"><i>PLATE VIII.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The uniform of the hospital nurse partakes somewhat
of that of the nun, but at the same time the
apron is often one of its most important features. We
mention this uniform here because it has become
customary of recent years for the nurses who look
after the children of well-to-do families to assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the bonnet and veil and severely cut collars and cuffs
of the hospital nurse.</p>

<p>Here again we get a case on all fours with the
adoption of evening dress by waiters, and the gradual
assumption by the lower classes of the dress of their
social superiors.</p>

COCKADES</h2>

<p class="srt2">THE COCKADE A DEGENERATED CHAPERON&mdash;THE VARIETIES
OF THE COCKADE&mdash;COCKADE WEARERS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> cockade as we know it (see Figure <a href="#fig116">116</a>) is
now commonly worn by servants, but, like their
clothes generally, it was once used by their masters.
The books of an old-established firm of hat manufacturers
show that as late as 1789 cockades were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
worn by gentlemen themselves. Apparently in the
beginning, the sporting of a black cockade meant
allegiance to the House of Hanover. Now the use
of the ornaments is supposed to be confined to the
servants of Royalty and of those in the Royal service,
though this does not seem to be actually the case.
In a letter to the <cite>Morning Post</cite><a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Messrs. AndrÃ©
and Co. say that &ldquo;the practice has long been regarded
as a convenient and fitting sign of social
distinction, and that only such persons should assume
the cockade as enjoy hereditary rank or else some
position of importance in the State, including all
officers, military and civil.&rdquo; Yet they can find no
trace of the question even having been dealt with
by any authority, nor have the classes of persons
privileged to display the cockade been at any time
accurately defined.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 116.</span>&mdash;The cockade, known as the &ldquo;large treble,&rdquo; representing
a survival of the chaperon.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Sir Alfred Scott Gatty, Garter King-at-Arms,
points out that the matter is really outside the
College of Arms, and it does not come under the
jurisdiction of the Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s department,
which usually arranges all matters connected with
official dress.</p>

<p>Before, however, we touch on the various kinds of
cockades, and mention those by whom the different
types are at present worn, it will be well to deal with
the construction and evolution of the cockade, and
we shall be able to show that it has considerable
claims to be considered something more than a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
conventional rosette. As regards actual material,
the basis of the cockade consists of leather, which
is japanned, while a certain amount of ribbon may also
be used. In the case of mourning, we find that the
cockade should properly be covered with black cloth
(see Figure <a href="#fig117">117</a>), but nowadays a piece of crape is
often twisted round the one generally worn. The
ribbon is usually merely a small bow tied in the
middle of the rosette (see Figure <a href="#fig116">116</a>), but the centre
of the latter may be covered with ribbon and the bow
replaced by a button.</p>

<p>The cockades worn by the Royal servants on the
front of their three-cornered hats on state occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
(see Figure <a href="#fig120">120</a>) are large. The rosette has points,
while the upper part, or fan, shows them in profusion,
and there is no silk bow. The Royal cockade for
semi-state has a simple fan, while that worn on the
silk hat at ordinary times (see Figure <a href="#fig121">121</a>) has no fan,
but the edges are cut into points and there is a bow
of ribbon in the centre.</p>

<p>The ordinary fan cockade is used in various sizes,
and is shown in Figure <a href="#fig116">116</a>. This is called the
&ldquo;treble,&rdquo; and has a bow of ribbon as a rule. A
curious variety worn by the Chelsea Pensioners has
no ribbon, while a segment is cut from the lower part
of the rosette (see Figure <a href="#fig118">118</a>). The only other variety
with regard to shape that we have now to mention is
the &ldquo;regent&rdquo; cockade, which is exactly like the treble,
but without the fan. (See Figure <a href="#fig119">119</a>.)</p>

</div></div>

<p>It appears that the cockade can lay claim to have
been descended from a very ancient and curious form
of head-dress, and Mr. Calthrop<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> has traced in a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
interesting way the development of this, as well as of
the cockade which is a survival of it in miniature.
The head-dress in question was called a chaperon,
and came into favour in the time of Richard II. It
was itself derived from a hood and a cape which were
originally worn separately, but afterwards the two
were joined together for convenience, so that they
could both be donned at the same time. Fashion
lengthened out the peak of the hood extravagantly until
it reached nearly to the ground, and then the prolongation
was called a liripipe. Next it was ordained
that the whole arrangement should be twisted up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
round the head, so that what was in the beginning a
cape with jagged edges stuck out on one side like
a cock&rsquo;s comb.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 34em;"><a id="fig124-125"></a>

<p>(After Calthrop, by kind permission of Messrs. A. and C. Black.)</p>
</div></div>

<p>It will be noticed that the modern cockade shows
the jagged edges sticking up, and it would appear
that the rosette represents a coiled-up liripipe. Even
to-day cockades are of various colours, and, as Mr.
Calthrop points out, the servant&rsquo;s chaperon from
which it was derived used to bear the colours of the
master&rsquo;s livery. The chaperon is also to be seen on
the robes of the Knights of the Garter at the present
day, where it is fixed on the right shoulder as a kind
of cape. (See Figure <a href="#fig144">144</a>.) Mr. Calthrop also
points out that the present head-dress of the French
lawyer is another descendant of the chaperon, and
that the buttons worn by the members of the Legion
of Honour and other foreign Orders are connected
with the same idea.</p>

<p>A writer in the <cite>Sketch</cite><a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> sees in the rosette and fan
of the treble cockade the remnants of the crown and
star which we see on military uniforms. He says that
the earlier forms seem to have been made of metal,
which must surely be a mistake, though the cock of
the hat was, as we know, sometimes fastened up with
a brooch. The example which he figures, however,
and uses in support of his theory, is evidently a helmet
plate which displays the star, garter, and St. George&rsquo;s
Cross, the whole being surmounted by a crown, and
in the cockade he claims to see all these elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
in a modified condition. If this derivation of the
cockade were correct, it would be in keeping with the
quotation which the same writer gives from Cussan&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Handbook of Heraldry,&rdquo; that the privilege of wearing
a cockade is confined to the servants of officers in
the King&rsquo;s service, or those who by courtesy may be
regarded as such. The theory is that the servant is
a private soldier who when not wearing his uniform
retains this badge as a mark of his profession. We
cannot help thinking that Mr. Calthrop&rsquo;s derivation
of the cockade is more feasible, though it is not easy
to see the remains of the coiled-up liripipe of the
chaperon in the way which Mr. Calthrop represents
it in his sketch.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> In the majority of the cockades
there is no trace of a spiral such as he indicates in
his figure, though in the mourning cockade, concentric
rings are very clearly shown. A word may
now be said as to those whose coachmen and footmen
wear cockades.</p>

<p>The Royal cockade is used by the servants of the
King, and by those belonging to members of the
Royal Household. It is large and circular, as we
have seen, and half the disk projects above the top
of the hat. The regent cockade, which has no fan, is
worn by the servants of naval officers, and no part of
it is allowed to project above the hat. The servants
of the officers in the Army, Yeomanry, Militia, and
Volunteers wear the treble cockade with the fan, as
do also the Lords Lieutenant and their deputies, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
well as the servants of the members of the Diplomatic
Corps. Besides this, it appears that the same kind
of cockade is worn by the servants of the following:
All peers and their sons and daughters, baronets,
knights, and sheriffs, judges, justices, and magistrates;
members and high officers of Parliament and
of the Civil Service; dignitaries of the Church,
King&rsquo;s Counsel, and law officers of the Crown.</p>

<p>English ambassadors have the fan painted with
three stripes of red, white, and blue, and while the
edge of the rosette is red, the next part is white, and
the centre blue. In this case also the ribbon in the
centre shows the same three colours. The cockade of
the Danish ambassador is of ordinary black leather,
but the centre is covered with a rosette of ribbon, red
at the edge, with a circle of white next to it, and
green in the centre, while the whole is finished off
with an ornamental black button or knob. Other
foreign ambassadors have their cockades coloured
upon the same principle as the English; but in some
the colours are shown on the fan in bands instead of
in stripes, and the centre of the rosette may have
segments of different colours instead of rings. In
the case of the French ambassador the colours on the
fan are in stripes, while those of the rosette are in
segments.</p>

<p>Of recent years cockades have been reduced in
size until they have become mere pigmies in connection
with the uniform of &ldquo;chauffeurs,&rdquo; or motorcar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
drivers. The latter customarily wear a military
kind of hat with a mushroom top, and as a cockade
fastened on the side of one of these would not look
elegant, a very small cockade is now made and fixed
in the front of the cap just above the peak. Would
not one of the wearers of the old cock&rsquo;s-comb turbans
be amazed if he could see the most recent outcome of
his head-dress in its modern surroundings?</p>

<p>There seems to be little doubt but that the
&ldquo;cockade&rdquo; forms part of the livery of many who
have no recognized right to it. Perhaps the ease
with which it can be assumed is shown by the price
lists of jobmasters, in which we find, after the charge
for the hire of broughams and victorias, a footnote
to the effect that cockades are &ldquo;6d. extra if required.&rdquo;</p>

CHILDREN&rsquo;S DRESS</h2>

<p class="srt1">SURVIVALS IN CHILDREN&rsquo;S DRESS&mdash;SPECIAL SCHOOL COSTUMES&mdash;THE
BLUE-COAT BOY&mdash;PUBLIC SCHOOL BOYS&mdash;ADOPTION
OF A SPECIAL DRESS AT GIRLS&rsquo; SCHOOLS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Children&rsquo;s</span> costume, though characteristic,
is in some instances connected with ceremonies,
and in others with particular institutions; it
may therefore with advantage be considered at this
point.</p>

<p>We find that for very many centuries in this
country, children, except when small babies and in
their early years, were dressed practically in the same
way as their parents, and looked like men and women
in miniature.</p>

<p>The ludicrous effect that was sometimes produced
is well seen in Hogarth&rsquo;s engravings, which date
from the time when infants were powdered and
patched as well as dressed in a way that made them
truly grotesque.</p>

<p>A relic of this custom is still to be seen in certain
costumes which it is now fashionable for children to
wear. Possibly the sailor&rsquo;s suit takes the most prominent
place, and the Highland dress is also a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
favourite. It is perhaps not very strange that we do
not see little boys going about in the uniform of
policemen, and until the South African war occupied
the attention of this country, boys were seldom if
ever seriously dressed as soldiers, but during the
struggle to which allusion has been made, it was
not an uncommon sight to see small boys in the
khaki uniform and slouch hats which were adopted
by the troops in Africa. Now, of course, the knickerbockers
of the small boy, and the short skirts of his
little sisters, though not absolutely characteristic of
extreme youth, are recognized features of children&rsquo;s
costume.</p>

<p>As regards small infants, it is still customary for
some time after they are born to wrap more or less of
a bandage round them in order to protect their tender
bodies from injury. The modern &ldquo;binder&rdquo; is, of
course, a relic of swaddling clothes, or those which
consisted of a profusion of bandages. These still
survive in the Holy Land. It may here be said that
we meet in the word &ldquo;pupa,&rdquo; which is the scientific
term that we apply to a chrysalis, with the old
Greek name for a baby in swaddling clothes. It is
used now because the wings and legs of the future
flying insect are hidden in something the same way
as are the legs and arms of the much trussed-up
baby. From the same word we get the name &ldquo;puppet&rdquo;
and the French word &ldquo;poupÃ©e,&rdquo; meaning a doll.</p>

<p>In Roman Catholic churches at the time of baptism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
it is still the custom to place on the head of the
baby a white cloth. It is now too small to cover
the body, and it is called the chrysome, or chrism
cloth, and with it once the newly-baptized infant was
swathed. This was worn for a month by the child,
and if the latter died within that time the cloth was
used as a shroud. The chrysome is really the remains
of a series of vestments which in the sixth or
seventh century were worn by the newly baptized.
The most important part of the costume was the
albe, which was probably similar to that worn by
the clergy, and a chaplet of flowers was also used to
crown the child after baptism.</p>

<p>There are in this country still a few monumental
brasses called chrysom brasses showing babies in
their baptismal robes. A case where the child is
swathed up even more rigidly than was customary in
the old world is to be seen in the case of the North
American Indian papoose, which is fastened down to
a cradle of board or basket work, and at first is so
fixed by the swaddling process that only its head is
movable. In some instances several months elapse
before even the arms are allowed to be free, and
these are fastened up again at night.</p>

<p>It is probably owing to deformities that were at
first accidentally caused by this bandaging process,
that the fashions arose which demand that the shape
of the skull in certain races shall be intentionally
and artificially altered. To this subject, however, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
shall refer again when dealing with the question of
the effects of clothes upon the body.</p>

<p>As might well be imagined, the petticoats of small
boys are a survival, and one which is to be commended
in every way. The putting of infants at an early age
into jersey knickerbocker suits cannot but be bad for
them physically, and it makes them look for all the
world like little woollen monkeys. Mr. Druitt<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> has
described as many as seven brasses of various dates
between the years 1585 and 1642, which show boys
dressed in petticoats.</p>

<p>Dr. Alice Vickery thinks that it would be well if
infant boys and girls were dressed exactly alike, say
up to the age of five or seven. She says it is difficult
to judge the extent to which sex bias is imbibed in
the earliest years, and we should do our best to postpone
it as long as possible. She continues<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;If
boys and girls were dressed alike, taught together
and played together, this would do much to direct
attention away from, instead of towards, sex distinction.
The longer such a system could be maintained
the longer would be the period during which rewards
and punishments, praise and blame, would attach to
actions and conduct, to the exercise of self-control,
kindliness and generosity, efficiency, industry and
alertness, quite apart from all intrusions of sex idea,
and its possibilities of subjection and predominance.
That would in itself be a great gain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best school for the training of life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
conduct is the school of equality, where privilege and
subjection are alike unknown, and the co-education
of the sexes is a step in the direction of justice and
fraternity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one point more on which I will add
a few words. I have always been a great sceptic as
to the essential physical inferiority of the feminine.
It is true that in the aggregate that inferiority does
exist, but where can we find a place, a people among
whom the development of girlhood has had full and
free scope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The custom for young girls to wear their hair down
is also an old one, though married ladies of the
fifteenth century are occasionally represented with
flowing tresses.</p>

<p>At the present day, as a rule, when a girl puts up
her hair her petticoats are usually lengthened simultaneously.
The age at which these important changes
are made varies. For instance, if a girl has a number
of unmarried sisters older than herself, the time
is often put off. Sometimes the term &ldquo;old-fashioned&rdquo;
is synonymous with &ldquo;sensible,&rdquo; and people
with such ideas very often keep their girls in short
frocks until they are really grown up.</p>

<p>The two changes in the girls&rsquo; method of dressing
are not, however, always made at the same time. In
the upper classes we find a tendency for the long
dress to come first. Girls, on the other hand, who
have to go out into the world as nursemaids and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
kitchenmaids, may, in order to make themselves look
older and more sedate, put up their hair while they
are still in short frocks, though it must be said
that the effect is not quite pleasing if it is business-like.</p>

<p>In the bib of the infant we find a relative of that
part of the apron or the more voluminous pinafore
which covers the chest. Although grown-up women
sometimes wear pinafores, these, like the bibs, must
now be considered as part of children&rsquo;s dress, though
no doubt in the beginning they were derived from the
costume of grown-up people.</p>

<p class="plate"><i>PLATE IX.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The next subject that we may appropriately consider
here is that of the characteristic costumes which
are worn in certain schools. In connection with boys,
the first case which immediately comes to mind is
that of the Blue-coat boys, as the scholars of Christ&rsquo;s
Hospital, which was founded in 1552, have come to
be called. Their blue coat is part of the ordinary
dress of the citizen of the reign of Edward&nbsp;VI, and
the scholarly man at this time had the skirts of his
blue coat long, while in other cases they were cut off
at the knee. Instead of trunks, however, the Blue-coat
boy wears more modern knickerbockers, but he
clings to his yellow stockings. (See Plate <a href="#plate09b">IX</a>,
Figure <span class="f8"><a href="#plate09b">B</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The scholars of Christ&rsquo;s Hospital have discarded
caps (see Plate <a href="#plate09">IX</a>, Figure <span class="f8"><a href="#plate09a">A</a></span>), but the one which
should go with their dress is flat, like the one which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
came into fashion in the reign just mentioned. It
was the one afterwards called the statute cap, when
Elizabeth for the good of trade ordered that &ldquo;one
cap of wool, knitted thick and dressed in England,&rdquo;
was to be worn &ldquo;by all over six years of age except
such persons as had twenty marks a year in land and
their heirs and such as have borne office of worship.&rdquo;
A cap of the same kind was worn by Edward&nbsp;VI,
and is still part of the dress of Beef-eaters at the
Tower of London.</p>

<p>The blue coat afterwards came to be the ordinary
livery of serving-men in the sixteenth and early part
of the seventeenth centuries, and blue is still a
popular colour for coachmen&rsquo;s liveries at the present
day.</p>

<p>In a similar way we find that certain schools are
called grey-coat or green-coat schools, and we have
blue schools&mdash;for instance, one for boys and another
for girls at Wells.</p>

<p>Then there is the Red Maid School, which was
established in 1627 at Bristol, and in accordance with
the founder&rsquo;s will the girls are dressed in red frocks,
with white aprons and tippets and plain straw bonnets,
trimmed with blue ribbon. In connection with
this foundation it may be said that Â£50 is set on one
side each year for the award of marriage portions to
girls who have left the school.</p>

<p>Our public schools afford us very interesting cases
of special dresses. Perhaps no other coat which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
a boy wears is so well known as the Eton jacket.
This is accompanied by a tall silk hat.</p>

<p>King&rsquo;s scholars who are on the foundation and live
&ldquo;in College&rdquo; also wear an academical gown of fairly
ample proportions. The Eton jacket was not always
black, and originally the head-dress was a mortar-board,
and there was a broad lace collar or bands
round the neck (see page <a href="#Page_47">47</a>). The black coats and
top hats were introduced in 1820 as mourning for
King George&nbsp;III, and have been worn ever since.
The broad collar which takes its name from Eton is
probably a survival of lace bands, and is worn over
the jacket in the same way.</p>

<p>Very similar coats are also worn by the younger
boys at Westminster and at Harrow. In the latter
case the jacket finishes off in a small point at the
back, whereas the jacket worn at Eton is cut straight.
The older boys at Eton wear a morning coat, a stick-up
collar, and a white tie. This white tie is also
worn by the masters, whether they be clerks in holy
orders or not, and it seems to be a survival of a white
choker which was wound round and round the stick-up
collar, though, on the other hand, it may represent
academical bands.</p>

<p>At Winchester the scholars wear bands, and this is
no doubt connected with the use of academical dress,
for it is usual for the boys on the foundation of public
schools, as we have seen to be the case at Eton, to
wear gowns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The upper boys at Harrow, on the other hand,
wear dress-coats with swallow tails; but should, however,
a lower boy outgrow his short jacket, he is
given what is called &ldquo;charity&rdquo; tails.</p>

<p>When speeches are made at Eton, those who take
part in the performance wear dress-coats, knee-breeches,
silk stockings, and buckled shoes.</p>

<p>Some costumes have probably been in existence
since the foundation and endowment of the schools,
and we can find parallel cases in the dress of some
almshouses and hospitals for pensioners. Probably
the idea originally underlying the wearing of a special
dress is the same as is to be seen in modern charity
schools, where all the boys or girls are dressed alike.
It must simplify the tailoring and dressmaking
arrangements, but at the same time it intentionally or
unintentionally brands the children. Nevertheless,
we see that the boys at most aristocratic and celebrated
schools are in very much the same kind of
boat.</p>

<p>To return to Eton again, we might mention one or
two fashions in the ordinary dress which are curious.
It is ordained that the lowest button of the waistcoat
should be left unbuttoned and the bottom of the
trousers should be turned up, while it is part of
the performance to thrust the hands deeply into the
trouser pockets. If a boy elects to wear an overcoat,
and he does not occupy a certain definite position or
status in the school, public opinion forces him to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the collar of his top coat turned up. Of course,
schools generally, and sometimes the various houses
in important schools, make a particular point of school
or house colours.</p>

<p>At Eton, on the Fourth of June, in connection with
the boating there are interesting ornamentations added
to the straw hats in the shape of flowers, and three
boys who act as coxswains wear the uniform of an
admiral and carry bouquets. The Fourth of June
celebrations were instituted to take the place of the
festival known as the Eton Montem. The ceremony
consisted of a procession to a little hill near Slough,
when many old and interesting costumes were worn.</p>

<p>The custom came to an end in the early years of
Queen Victoria&rsquo;s reign, and its immediate object was
the collecting of money with which to send the head
boy of the year to the University. It seems, however,
to have originated in a piece of folk-lore,
probably connected with the old tree worship, but
sanctioned by the early Christian authorities as a
semi-religious function. In this connection it is
pleasant to think that flowers seen in the hats on the
Fourth of June are a survival of the green branches
and garlands that were once brought back each year
from the Montem expedition.</p>

<p>When dealing with children&rsquo;s dress we ought not to
forget the special costumes that have been adopted in
some private girls&rsquo; schools, nor how much is being
done in them towards disseminating ideas on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
subject of dress reform. For, after all, it is to the
women of the future that we must look if any
alteration is to be generally made. The introduction
of exercises in the gymnasium has necessitated the
adoption of a drilling dress in very many cases, but
there are schools where such a costume is generally
worn at all times, and others where it forms the
working dress, while long skirts are only put on when
no active exertion is expected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 126.</span>&mdash;Dress worn by the girls at Coombe Hill School, Westerham.
It is a modification of the Dervish Djibah.</p>
</div></div>

<p>At Coombe Hill School, Westerham, in Kent, the
dress takes the form of a tunic with wide sleeves
which come to the elbow (see Figure <a href="#fig126">126</a>). It is put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
over the head and has no fastenings. It is modelled
upon the Djibah of the Dervishes, and is made of soft
woollen material of a fawn colour. The yoke is of
green embroidery and the underslip is tussore. Under
the tunic a blouse of white silk is worn, and the
sleeves, of course, show from the elbow downwards.
The rest of the costume consists of cloth knickerbockers
and stockings, with sandals or shoes that are
made to the shape of the foot. This dress is worn on
all occasions at school, and the girls are very proud
of it.</p>

</div></div>

<p>At the Croft School, Betley, in school and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
any basket-making, book-binding, drilling, or Morris-dancing
is going on, a special costume is brought
into use. In this case it consists of a tunic without
sleeves, of red material with a velvet yoke, and
shoulder straps (see Figure <a href="#fig127">127</a>). As a finishing touch
there is a girdle tied loosely in a bow. It is not
placed round the waist proper, but drops towards
the left knee as did the sword-belts which the knights
in olden times wore over their armour. A white silk
blouse shows above the yoke round the neck and has
full sleeves. The knickerbockers in this case are
made of red knitted stockinette instead of cloth.
The whole costume has been carefully worked out,
and Miss Hodgson, one of the principals of the
school, has an interesting doll which is dressed
exactly like the girls. It should be said that all the
girls wear this dress whether they are nine or nineteen
years old, and as it is much appreciated by
them there is no doubt but that when they come to
have girls of their own they will support any movement
in favour of the more general adoption of a
sensible costume.</p>

WEDDING GARMENTS</h2>

<p class="srt2">THE VEIL&mdash;BRIDESMAIDS AND BRIBERY&mdash;OLD SHOES&mdash;ORANGE
BLOSSOM</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Weddings</span> are ceremonies in connection with
which we may look for some points of interest,
as customs in connection with them change but
slowly. In this country, if convention be followed,
the bride&rsquo;s dress is of white.</p>

<p>The veil that is worn recalls the primitive head-dress
that was bound by a fillet, and, like that of the nun,
may well be derived from the wimple, though it is
said to represent the canopy which in many countries,
and by the Jews in our own, is held over, or erected
above, the bride and bridegroom. Flowers take a part
in the adornment of the bride, and the special use of
orange blossom will be dealt with when discussing
wedding crowns.</p>

<p>It is customary for the bridesmaids to be dressed
alike, and they often wear some ornament which has
been presented to them by the bridegroom. It may
be that this is a survival like many other wedding
customs of the old marriage by capture, for in some
countries the girl friends of the bride will not allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
her to be approached by the bridegroom until he has
given them presents, or in reality bribed them. Now,
like tipping, it is merely a custom that must be followed,
but originally no doubt the bridegroom and
his accomplice, the best man, might have found that
what they could not do by force they might encompass
by bribery.</p>

<p>The expression &ldquo;to tie the nuptial knot&rdquo; takes its
origin from the fact that, among the Babylonians, the
priest who conducted the wedding used to take a
thread from the garment of the bride and another
from that of the bridegroom. These he tied together
into a knot and presented to the bride as a symbol of
the binding nature of the union between her and her
husband.</p>

<p>There is an article of dress which often plays a part
at weddings, for old shoes are usually thrown after the
newly-married pair, while boots, with a hole in them,
filled with rice, are hung from the backs of carriages,
and satin slippers have on occasion been fastened to
the carriage door handle of the railway train which
speeds the pair on their honeymoon.</p>

<p>We all know that the throwing of old slippers is intended
to bring luck to the bride and bridegroom,
but it is not apparent what particular form it is
intended that the blessing should take, and the origin
of the custom is difficult to determine. Mr. James E.
Crombie,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> after carefully considering the various
superstitions connected with weddings and shoes, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
come to the conclusion that the intention is to ensure
that the young couple shall be blessed with children,
and that old shoes are thrown because of the idea
that the essence or life of the individual that wore
them remains in them, and makes them powerful
talismans.</p>

<p>In this connection it may be well to consider the
importance which shoes have assumed at various
times in connection with weddings and otherwise.
So long ago as the year 1291, a law in Hamburg
ordered that the bridegroom should give his bride a
pair of shoes, and it is still a custom in Transylvania
for the bridegroom to make a similar present on his
wedding morning. In Greece the best man puts a
new pair of boots, supplied by the bridegroom, on to
the feet of the bride when she leaves her father&rsquo;s
house. In Bulgaria, a money present which the
bridegroom makes to the relatives of the bride is
called shoe money, and with it the father of the
family buys shoes for it. This money is said to be a
relic of the price that was paid to the clan from which
a wife was taken.</p>

<p>Shoes have figured as part of wages, and they
were thrown over the heads of the O&rsquo;Neils by the
O&rsquo;Cahans when the former were chosen chiefs. This
was done to symbolize the superiority of the throwers.
In Russia, the wives as part of the wedding festivities
remove their husband&rsquo;s boots in order to show their
subjection to him, though while the bride dutifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
takes off her lord and master&rsquo;s boots as a sign of subserviency,
she always hits him on the head with one
of them to show that she is not one whit inferior to
him. It is said that the Hebrew word for shoe and
wife are identical, and a Bedouin form of divorce is
&ldquo;She is my slipper, I have cast her off.&rdquo; The casting
of a shoe over land, as mentioned in the Bible, was
symbolical of conquering it.</p>

<p>As regards fruitfulness, the Eskimo women carry
a piece of an old shoe which has once been worn
by European sailors, to make them prolific mothers.
Women who are blessed with families in China present
shoes to the &ldquo;Mother goddess,&rdquo; and those who
wish for children borrow these shoes and vow that
if the desired result is effected they will present
another one to the divinity when the borrowed shoe
is returned.</p>

<p>Mr. Crombie gives a number of instances to show
that there is still a belief that the soul of persons may
live in their shoes. In the Museum of Northern
Antiquities at Copenhagen is a mummified corpse of
a woman who was intentionally drowned in a bog, and
from her body, after the murder, a shoe had been
removed. During the Arran murder case at Edinburgh,
in 1889, it transpired that the boots of the
murdered man had been removed by the local constable,
who had buried them on the seashore between
high and low water marks. No explanation was forthcoming,
though the man admitted that it was by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
orders of his senior officer that he put them out of
sight. There is no doubt but that the idea underlying
the action was that of preventing the ghost
of the murdered man from walking.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that shoes used to be
thrown after anybody when he or she was starting on
a journey, which in old days was a risky business, and
Ben Jonson wrote, &ldquo;Would I had Kemp&rsquo;s shoes to
throw after you.&rdquo; This has been interpreted as meaning
that Kemp was a lucky individual, and that something
of him and his good fortune remained in his
shoes. Summing up his remarks, Mr. Crombie says
with regard to throwing shoes at weddings that by
doing so &ldquo;we should be doing for the young couple,
in a more pleasant way, exactly the same as the relatives
of the Galla bride did for her when they
anointed her from top to toe with bullock&rsquo;s blood.
We should be doing for them with shoes what our
Aryan ancestors did for their cattle with the sacred
parna rod, and what the herdsmen of Sweden and
The Mark do to this day, when on the 1st of May
they watch on which branch of the mountain ash the
sun first strikes, and then, cutting it down, beat the
yearling heifers with it on the loins and haunches,
repeating at each stroke a verse in which they pray
that as sap comes into the birch so may milk fill the
cow&rsquo;s udder. We should be doing with shoes what
the Romans did in ancient Rome at the festival of the
Lupercalia, when the boys, armed with strips of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
skin of the slaughtered goats, used to rush through
the city striking all they met, and where women,
particularly those who desired to be made fruitful,
placed themselves naked in the way, and received the
blows of the Luperci on their palms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At a wedding sometimes the priest&rsquo;s vestments play
a part. It is customary in some continental countries
for the priest to wrap the hands of the bride and
bridegroom in his stole, and even in some of our
English churches the contracting parties are instructed
to take hold of the stole by the officiating
clergyman. We might mention that in many countries
the bridal dresses are very beautiful, and are
often survivals of very old-fashioned costumes. The
Norwegian bridal dress is an instance of this. The
wearing of a bridal crown is also a custom in Scandinavia,
where it is said that every parish possesses its
special crown which is the property of the church,
but the use of it is only sanctioned when the bride
bears an irreproachable character.</p>

<p>The wearing of orange blossom has apparently the
same meaning, and it may be mentioned that on
funeral monuments or brasses the wearing of a garland
by the effigy of a girl means that she died a
virgin.</p>

MOURNING</h2>

<p class="srt2">COLOURS ASSOCIATED WITH MOURNING&mdash;WIDOWS&rsquo; WEEDS&mdash;PERENNIAL
MOURNING</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> ceremonies connected with death and burial
are no exception to the rule which we have laid
down, that on solemn and important occasions primitive
customs and costumes are most commonly to be
met with. The making of clothes from bark has
come to have a special significance in the case of
races which no longer adopt this in everyday life.
The Kayans of Borneo now ordinarily wear smart
foreign stuffs which they get from traders; but when
they go into mourning they discard these garments,
and return once more to the old native garment of
bark cloth. The putting on of sackcloth is no doubt
a similar custom, and dishevelling of locks is also in
keeping with it.</p>

<p>Among the many curious customs connected with
funeral rites which survive in civilized countries, the
adoption of some kind of mourning dress is very
general. Sombre black has come to be associated in
our minds with mourning, but other colours are used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
among other nations, and even in this country. The
drapery with which the hats of the hired mourners
at a child&rsquo;s funeral are veiled are white instead of
black. White ostrich feathers may appear on the
horses&rsquo; heads, and white adorns their trappings.
Royalty is still privileged to have a special mourning
colour&mdash;purple is used at state funerals, and grey is
looked upon as half-mourning.</p>

<p>In China white is the colour used instead of black,
and other Oriental nations wear yellow. In modern
Egypt, at a funeral, the women, whether relatives or
servants of the deceased, are distinguished by a strip
of linen or muslin bound round the head and tied in
a single knot behind. This stuff is usually of a blue
colour. The women of ancient Egypt, as shown on
the walls of tombs, wore a similar bandage round
their head. Excessive mourning is now becoming a
thing of the past, and there is no need now for such
laws as were made at the end of the fifteenth century
to restrict extravagance in mourning attire. Nowadays
men may follow the custom observed by those in
the army and those who wear Highland dress of
putting a black band round their arm. At the most
they wear black clothes and put a wider band round
their hats. Among women it is only widows who
wear a special costume. It is not a becoming one,
though sometimes a smartness is imparted to it that
is a little out of keeping with the idea of mourning.
Now a widow&rsquo;s dress is called weeds, though this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
term at one time signified the whole of any woman&rsquo;s
costume.</p>

<p>For the origin of the widow&rsquo;s veil we must go back
to mediÃ¦val times, when the dress of widow ladies
was similar to that of the convent. It was the custom
of elderly ladies whose husbands had died to
become what is called vowesses, and to go into
seclusion. A relic perhaps of the practice is to be
found in the kind of prejudice which still exists in
the minds of some people against second marriages.
The white cuffs of the widow recall those of the
nurse, and similar ones are used by some members of
the legal profession as part of their mourning.</p>

<p>When dealing with military costume we shall
find that signs of mourning, when once adopted,
have in some cases never been wholly abandoned.
There are similar vestiges like those found in the
dress of public schools, and there has been a suggestion
of the same thing happening in the Navy.</p>

<p>In connection with the hired mourners or mutes at
funerals, now so solemnly habited in black, it may be
interesting to recall that the old Roman mimes, of
whom we have seen that Punch was originally one,
were employed at funerals to imitate the language
and manners of the deceased.</p>

COSTUME CONNECTED WITH THE
CHRISTIAN RELIGION</h2>

<p class="srt1">THE SURPLICE AND &ldquo;THE CLOTH&rdquo;&mdash;THE CIVIL ORIGIN OF
VESTMENTS&mdash;SPECIAL VESTMENTS&mdash;PROCESSIONAL VESTMENTS,
SO CALLED&mdash;NUNS&rsquo; DRESS&mdash;THE CHOKER</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> dress worn by clergy when conducting
religious ceremonies offers many opportunities
for studying the development of garments, and illustrates
at the same time how the dress used by a
special class may evolve more slowly and on different
lines from the same clothes that may be worn by the
people at large. The case is similar to that of animals
or plants which are isolated from the other members
of their species, and in course of time come to differ
very markedly from their far-away relatives who
flourish in the old home.</p>

<p>We shall see that many of the ecclesiastical vestments
can be traced to civil dress; but for the moment
we may discuss those which are in use at the present
time, and which afford additional evidence in support
of our statement that the more important the ceremonial,
the more ancient the costume. At the present
day we find that the clergy of the Church of England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
preach either in a white surplice or in a black gown.
We can trace the black gown to an order made by
James&nbsp;I, but at the present day the vestments worn
by the clergy of the Presbyterian Churches are rather
professional, or academical like a barrister&rsquo;s gown,
than properly ecclesiastical. We have already mentioned
the bands (see p. <a href="#Page_44">44</a>) which are worn with the
black gown, and here we might mention that when
the preacher ministers to a recognized congregation
he wears them, though if he is ordained but is conducting
an occasional service he does not.</p>

<p>Charles&nbsp;I gave instructions that the surplice should
be worn, and had an Act passed giving him power to
regulate clerical costume. But the clergy sent in a
petition that matters should be left as they were, and
this request seems to have been granted, as some of
the ministers at the time expressed the fear that
His Majesty would order them to wear hoods and
bells. Mr. Macalister<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> says that the surplice was
originally invented to take the place of the albe,
which was made so small that it was difficult to put
it over the cassock when the latter garment was thick
and lined with fur.</p>

<p>Originally the surplice was put on over the head, in
the same way as the albe, the place of which it took,
but some two hundred years ago the surplice was
made open in front and fastened at the neck with a
button. The reason for this is that in this way the
surplice could be put on without disarranging the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
enormous wigs which were worn during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. The cassock, to
which we have already alluded, was a long, loose coat
or gown, which was worn by both sexes from the
eleventh century onwards. The name was applied to
the coat adopted by foot soldiers in the time of
Elizabeth. In the case of the laity, it was abandoned
in favour of the shorter and more convenient coat.</p>

<p>The black coat of the modern clergy, whom we
term &ldquo;the cloth,&rdquo; no doubt represents it, while it
is of course worn ordinarily by many Roman Catholic
clergy, and some High Churchmen, as an everyday
garment, for which it was originally intended. The
row of buttons which now fasten the long cassocks
from neck to the foot have been humorously compared
by Lord Grimthorpe to the close row of rivets
on a boiler.</p>

<p>With regard to the development of the more ornamental
dress of the clergy there is a great deal to be
said. In the past, two separate origins for it have
been suggested, and to pursue either of these would
be to take us far back into history. It has been
claimed, in the first place, that modern church vestments
have been derived from those of the Levitical
priesthood. The other idea is that the ceremonial
dress of the clergy was derived from the civil costume
of the Romans. It appears, however, that careful
researches have shown that the decorations which
have given ecclesiastical vestments their highly ornamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
character&mdash;in which they resemble certainly
those used by the Jews in Temple worship&mdash;have
been gradually acquired.</p>

<p>The dress of the ancient Christians was simple, and
it seems likely that owing to the poverty of the early
Church rich clothing could hardly have been adopted.
Besides, for many centuries there is no mention of
such vestments as we are considering, and no records
as to their having been derived from Jewish models.
On the other hand, everything points to a more
natural origin of the raiment concerned. Flowing
garments, as we have already seen, give dignity, and
we find that among the Romans such were used in
dignified leisure or on occasions of state, in contradistinction
to the dress of active existence, which
consisted of a short tunic or chiton. It is with the
first kind of dress that we have to deal.</p>

<p>It consisted of a tunic either short or long, over
which was worn the toga which was capable of the
same variety of arrangement as the plaid which still
survives. Even when the toga was given up by the
people generally, on the founding of the Roman
Empire, it continued to be used in certain cases.</p>

<p>It was etiquette to wear a toga when dining with
the Emperor or going to court; advocates wore it,
as did clients when they visited their patrons, and
it was also adopted at funerals and when sacrifices
were being made.</p>

<p>On the face of it, it would appear likely that those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
who ministered to the early Christian Church would
follow the general custom. Nothing, perhaps, affords
better evidence of this having taken place than an
illustration which is considered authentic of St.
Gregory the Great with his father and mother. As
Mr. Marriott<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> points out, if it were not for the Papal
pallium&mdash;that is to say, the band round his shoulders&mdash;on
which crosses are embroidered, and the book of
the Gospels which he holds in his hand, it would be
hard to distinguish which was the bishop and which
the senator. (See Figure <a href="#fig128">128</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

senator, on his right, and his mother Sylvia on his left. This shows the
similarity between ecclesiastical and civil costume in early times. From
an authentic picture (after Marriott).</p>
</div></div>

<p>From this dress it is claimed, by those who have
carefully gone into the question, that ecclesiastical
vestments have been developed. In connection with
this, Mr. Macalister<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> makes the following remarks:
&ldquo;Fashion in dress or ornaments is subject to constant
changes, which, though perhaps individually
trifling, in time amount to complete revolutions; but
the devotees of any religion, true or false, are by
nature conservative of its doctrines or observances.
At first the early Christians wore the same costume
both at worship and at home. Fashion,&rdquo; Mr.
Macalister continues, &ldquo;would slowly change unchecked
from year to year, while ecclesiastical conservatism
would retard such changes as far as they
concern the dress worn at divine service; small
differences would spring into existence between everyday
dress and the dress of the worshipper. These
differences, at first hardly perceptible, would increase
as the process went on, until the two styles of
costume became sharply distinguished from one
another.&rdquo; In this connection it will be interesting
to mention those vestments which antiquarians have
traced to Roman costume.</p>

<p>The albe takes its name from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tunica alba</i>, which
was used as a purely secular garment until the ninth
century. It was worn by all the ministers and
deacons, but as the latter had no vestment above the
albe, it came to be the special characteristic of the
deacons. Usually, as the name implies, the albe was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
white, but in this country coloured albes were sometimes
used.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the surplice was derived
from the albe, and Mr. Marriott has brought forward
all the evidence that he can to show that white was
the colour of the vestments at the earliest times in
the history of the Church. His arguments, however,
do not seem to be conclusive, and his inferences do
not commend themselves to Mr. Macalister. The
latter thinks, however, that the view that white was
the colour appropriated in primitive times to the dress
of the Christian ministry is preferable to the theory
that the early vestments were of the same elaborate
description as their mediÃ¦val successors. He is of
opinion, nevertheless, that the passages upon which
Mr. Marriott bases his arguments are quite consistent
with a third alternative, namely, that no distinctive
vestments were set apart for the exclusive use of the
Christian minister during the first four centuries of
the Christian era.</p>

<p>The dalmatic was a wide gown or tunic with long
full sleeves, which was derived apparently from the
albe and used by persons in high secular positions
before it was adopted by the Church. In the
mediÃ¦val period the dalmatic was slit for a short
distance up either side and fringes were added to
decorate the slits, the hems, and the ends of the
sleeves. In this style the garment was worn by a
bishop. There were, however, only fringes on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
left sleeves and along the left side in the form of this
vestment which was appropriated to a deacon.</p>

<p>Most elaborate explanations were offered by mediÃ¦val
writers for this difference, which seems merely
to be a matter of convenience for the deacon, who
served at the altar. It was important that he should
have his right side free, and the heavy fringes would
have got into his way. One of the ideas with regard
to the fringe was that the absence from the right side
symbolizes our freedom from care in the world to
come; but why, Mr. Macalister asks, was not the
bishop to be exempt from care in the future world? In
connection with the coronation of English sovereigns
the dalmatic is still used, as well as representatives
of other ecclesiastical vestments, but to these we shall
refer again.</p>

<p>It is not at all unlikely that the stole which a
clergyman wears after the fashion of an untied tie,
and which hangs from his neck nearly to the ground,
is really the same thing as our handkerchief, and it is
certain that it was employed originally as a scarf or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">orarium</i>. In many Roman monuments which are not
of an ecclesiastical character, scarves are worn over
the rest of the dress. They pass over the left shoulder,
diagonally, towards the right side, and are fastened
under the right arm. They are not to be confounded with
the two bands of purple (or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clavi</i>) which on the tunics
of senators and other important men ran round the
sides of the neck openings and down to the lower hem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>It is probable that the scarves were used in the same
way as favours and &ldquo;colours&rdquo; among ourselves. It
is recorded that Aurelian was the first emperor who
distributed &ldquo;oraria&rdquo; as presents to the people to be
worn as favours. In this connection we must not
forget the ribbons of the Knightly Orders, which we
have already mentioned when speaking of the baldric.</p>

<p>The Fourth Council of Toledo enacted that deacons
should wear their stoles over their left shoulder so
that their right arm might be free to facilitate the
execution of their duties in divine service. An
English church vestment actually goes by the name
of the scarf, and is a broad black band of silk worn in
the same way as the stole. It is probably a modification
of some article of university costume, possibly
the tippet (see p. <a href="#Page_212">212</a>), and is worn by Doctors of
Divinity and the clerical authorities of Collegiate and
Cathedral bodies.</p>

<p>The outdoor garment which replaced the toga took
several forms. One of these had already been in use
for some time as part of the dress of the lower classes
and of slaves. Speaking briefly, it rose in the world,
and emperors even wore it when they were travelling.
One form, called the casula, is of interest to us because
it is the forerunner of the chasuble.</p>

<p>So much attention has been drawn to ecclesiastical
vestments of recent years, owing to the adoption by
English High Church clergy of those in which Roman
Catholic priests celebrate Mass, that it may be perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of interest, even at the risk of recapitulation, to
consider them. It should be said at the outset that the
stripes of embroidery, which are often very elaborate
and enriched with jewels, which appear on vestments
such as the amice and albe, are called apparels.</p>

<p>To garments which are white and have at times to
be washed, these ornaments are sewn or otherwise
attached, so that they can be removed when it is
necessary and replaced. The amice we have not yet
mentioned, as it is of mediÃ¦val origin and did not
come into our consideration of the evolution of modern
vestments from Roman dress. It was a rectangular
piece of linen, about thirty-six inches by twenty-five
inches, with an apparel sewn along one edge and a
cross embroidered in the centre. This the priest at
the present time wears round his neck. The outer
garment or chasuble, which is richly ornamented,
we have traced to the garment which replaced the
Roman toga, and as it is without sleeves and has
become heavier, it has been found necessary to slit
up the sides. Under this the stole is worn over the
albe, and only its ends appear beneath the chasuble.
(See Figure <a href="#fig129">129</a>.) There is ornamentation on the
sleeves of the albe, where they show, and on the back
and front of it where it shows below the chasuble.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;"><a id="fig129"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 129.</span>&mdash;A priest in the vestments now worn at the celebration
of the Eucharist.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The apparels, according to Druitt, are possibly the
remains of the purple bands and other ornamentations
of the Roman tunic, from which we have seen that
the albe was derived. Over the left arm the priest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
carries a maniple which is something like a stole.
This was originally made of linen, and worn over the
fingers of the left hand. There is no doubt but that
it was once a napkin and, according to Mr. G.
C. Coulton,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> originally used in the fashion of a
modern pocket-handkerchief. That it was a napkin
is shown by quotations from ancient writers, and
there seems no doubt also that many refinements of
Roman civilization, of which the pocket handkerchief
was one, were lost in the later Middle Ages. In fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the handkerchief only began to come into general use
in polite society about Henry&nbsp;VIII&rsquo;s reign, and the
maniple of the ministrant at the altar must have lost
its original use, or Bernard would not have twice
warned him against blowing his nose on his chasuble
or surplice.</p>

<p>When speaking of the handkerchief, there is
another use which we may mention. It was often
employed for ceremonial purposes in connection with
the giving of presents, and this idea seems to have
come from Eastern lands, where gifts are wrapped in
highly ornamental covers. In the parable of the
talents, one of them, it will be remembered, was wrapped
in a napkin, and even to-day the labourer has his
dinner taken to him in a brightly coloured cotton
handkerchief.</p>

<p>Among the special vestments of bishops are the
dalmatic, which we have already described, and the
tunicle, which originally did not differ from it, and
began to be worn beneath it about the twelfth century.
Others are the buskins or stockings (which were
originally reserved for the pope), sandals, ring, gloves,
and mitre, together with a pastoral staff adapted from
the shepherd&rsquo;s crook.</p>

<p>Archbishops have a cross staff and a pallium or
pall which is probably derived from the same ancestor
as the stole, namely the orarium, which, we have seen,
was a favour or distinction granted by the Roman
Emperor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The word pallium has been applied to a number of
garments in the past, many of which were of a flowing
character, and some writers have seen in the
archbishop&rsquo;s pall a small vestige of what was once
an ample vestment. Early pictures, however, show
the pall looped round the shoulders with one end
hanging in front of the body and one behind. Mr.
Macalister says that it was difficult sometimes to distinguish
between it and the stole, and that the next
step in its evolution was to knot the free ends to the
loops as shown in the eighth, ninth, and tenth
centuries. From this it was but an easy step to the
final form which consists of an oval loop with a long
tail pendent from each of its ends, so that when it is
worn on the person it makes a capital &ldquo;Y&rdquo; on the
back and another on the chest. It should be pointed
out that the pall must not be confounded with the
apparel of the chasuble called the orphrey, which also
has a &ldquo;Y&rdquo; shape.</p>

<p>In connection with the manufacture of the pall
there are some interesting proceedings. It is made
from the wool of two lambs, and they are solemnly
blessed on Saint Agnes&rsquo;s day in the church dedicated
in the name of that saint at Rome. The
animals are chosen with special reference to their
whiteness and goodness, and are carried into Rome
in separate baskets, which are slung over a horse&rsquo;s
back.</p>

<p>On the way to the church the Pope makes the sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of the cross from a window over the lambs, and they,
after Mass has been celebrated and they have been
blessed by the celebrant, go back to the Pope, who
sends them to a nunnery, where they are shorn and
the wool made into palls by the nuns.</p>

<p>The modern pall has six black crosses on it, but
previous to the eighth century it had sometimes four,
sometimes eight, worked in purple.</p>

<p>At first the pall was fastened by gold pins to the
chasuble to keep it in place, but just as ladies now
use little lead weights to keep parts of their dress in
position, so lead was used to hold the archbishop&rsquo;s pall
in place. The effigy of Albrect von Brandenburg in
1555, at Mayence, shows two palls, which probably
indicate that he was Archbishop of Magdeburg as
well as of Mayence. This repetition can hardly be
strictly correct, as the pall could only be worn within
the Archbishop&rsquo;s province.</p>

<p>Archbishops in olden days appeared to have had
no authority to act until they received their pall from
the Pope. The honour was, however, bestowed
occasionally on bishops. The pall is generally
shown on the coats of arms of archbishops. (See
Figure <a href="#fig130">130</a>.)</p>

<p>The cope is one of the so-called processional vestments.
It does not appear before the ninth century,
and is apparently connected with Roman dress. It
was an outer cloak without sleeves, and originally was
used as a protection from the weather at open-air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
processions in Rome, its ancestor probably being the
lacerna. In a similar way the almuce was a hood to
protect the head, and such articles, as Mr. Macalister
says, the clergy would continue to adopt in their cold
and draughty churches or in open-air processions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 16em;"><a id="fig130"></a>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 130.</span>&mdash;The coat of arms of Thomas Ã  Becket.
Showing an archbishop&rsquo;s pall.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Of monastic habits the earliest was the Benedictine,
consisting of a cassock over which was worn the cowl&mdash;a
large, loose gown, with hanging sleeves and a
hood attached to it. In the old times the costume of
abbesses and nuns resembled the mourning habit of
widows, who often retired to end their days in a convent.
When the English Church was reformed, the
Mass vestments practically disappeared. The first
Prayer Book of Edward&nbsp;VI prescribed for the Holy
Communion a white albe, without any apparels, with
a vestment or cope, while the assistant priest or
deacons were to wear albes with tunicles. The cope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
was also to be worn with a plain albe or surplice on
Wednesdays and Fridays when there was no communion.
The bishop was to wear a rochet, a surplice
or albe, and a cope or vestment. The second
Prayer Book prohibited the use of the albe, vestment,
or cope to the minister, allowing him only a surplice,
while the archbishop or bishop was allowed a rochet.
The Act of Uniformity upheld the ornaments rubric
of the first Prayer Book of Edward&nbsp;VI, and this has
never been superseded.</p>

<p>The lawn sleeves of the modern bishop developed
from the rochet, which was a kind of modified albe,
which at first had a kind of tight-fitting sleeves or
none at all. Over this rochet is worn a black satin
chimere, and as it was difficult to get this over the
bishop&rsquo;s sleeves, they were removed from the rochet
and are now fastened to the chimere. The black
scarf we have already considered.</p>

<p>It is customary at the present day for clergy of the
English Church to wear the academical hood of their
university degree over their surplices. This is ordained
by the fifty-eighth canon, but ministers who are
not graduates are permitted to wear, instead of hoods,
&ldquo;some decent tippet of black, be it not silk.&rdquo; It
appears that in the time of Elizabeth, in everyday
dress, ministers wore a gown and some of them a silk
hood. The tippet is a survival of the almuce, which
we mentioned in connection with the cope, and is one
of the so-called processional dresses. It must therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
not be confounded with the amice, which is a
truly ecclesiastical vestment.</p>

<p>As bearing on the conservatism of the Church in
matters of dress, we may mention that in Holland,
until recent times, the clergy wore a very old-fashioned
dress, or perhaps it may better be described as
a picturesque uniform, consisting of an old three-cornered
hat, and a coat resembling the ordinary
evening dress-coat, having a long pleated strip called
&ldquo;the mantle&rdquo; hooked on the neck, and obviously
being a survival from an early and more ample gown
of some kind. They wore knee-breeches buckled at
the knees, and buckled shoes, but this costume was
only used when the minister was officiating at service.</p>

<p>Some of the heads of the churches in Scotland
still adopt a kind of Court dress.</p>

<p>In turning for a moment again to the everyday
dress of the clergy, the method of fastening the
characteristic white choker at the back seems to have
come from the bands. Thackeray in &ldquo;The Newcomes&rdquo;
uses the name choker as meaning a white necktie,
and it was also applied to the old leather stocks
which the clerical collar, in its stiffness, resembles.
The bishop&rsquo;s hat we have already alluded to, as
showing the stage in a process of cocking, the brim
being tied to the crown by strings. The clerical
gaiters we can derive from the old episcopal buskins,
while the apron appears to be a vestige of the
cassock to which we have before referred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The dress of monks usually consists of a tunic or
closed gown and scapular, while there may be one or
more open gowns with a hood at the back.</p>

<p>Nuns or Sisters of Mercy are so commonly seen in
our streets, and they do so much for the benefit of the
poor, and take such a part in educational matters,
that their dress is very familiar to us. It is difficult
to say how old it may not be, and though stiff hoods
similar to those which are now in use by nuns were
adopted by women generally in Tudor times, we
find in the head-dress of Henry&nbsp;II&rsquo;s reign the counterpart
of the linen bands which surround the face and
hide the hair. The other garments of nuns may have
the same origin as ecclesiastical vestments, for the
dress of the Roman women was very much like that
of the men. (See Figures <a href="#fig128">128</a> and <a href="#fig131">131</a>-<a href="#fig133">133</a>.)</p>

<p>There are, of course, many orders, congregations,
and communities of nuns, but we may describe the
dress of one of the latter, and then make a few
additional remarks. In the case of the Kilburn
Sisters of the Church, who are English Catholics&mdash;but
who have dedicated their lives to religion in the
same way as the Roman Catholic nuns&mdash;the indoor
dress consists of a white cap, the descendant of the
Norman chin-band, which fits tightly round the head&mdash;as
the hair of all nuns is, of course, cut close&mdash;and
it is gathered round the face with a string. This cap,
if it comes down low on the forehead, correspondingly
covers the chin, but in many cases the latter is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
free. Over the white cap in indoor dress a black veil
is worn in the case of professed nuns, a blue veil by
novices, while postulants, who may be taken as
corresponding to probationers in a hospital, wear only
a cap, though in chapel they have a white veil as
well. Round the neck of the Sister is a white collar,
which in this case is separate from the cap and
buttons on to it at one side.</p>

<p>This collar, which like the veil may be traced to
the wimple of Norman and later ladies, is also called
a breast cloth or a gremial, and may be, as we have
indicated, made in one piece with the cap.</p>

<p>In outdoor dress a stiff white hood is placed over
the indoor head-dress, and over that again comes the
outdoor black veil.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that the Kilburn Sisters
now pin their veils to the sides of their linen caps in
exactly the same way that the dame in the time of the
early Plantagenets did her wimple to the sides of her
chin-band.</p>

<p>For working Sisters, the rest of the costume is
a habit with skin-tight sleeves, though there are
also most voluminous outer sleeves which are detachable
and can be removed. A small cape is buttoned
across the chest, and the number of buttons corresponds
with the letters in the word &ldquo;Obedience.&rdquo; An
apron is also worn and a thick girdle, to one of the
hanging ends of which a cross is attached. Other
Sisters wear a scapular with shoulder-straps, over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
white cape. Nuns are not allowed to wear gloves,
and some orders use sandals, though absolutely barefooted
orders exist.</p>

<p>The lay sisters of the community under consideration
wear a blue habit and a white cap with flaps.
Some orders, in addition to the white cap, wear a plain
band round the forehead over it, which is called a
frontal, and is seen in the dress of Henry&nbsp;II&rsquo;s
time. (See Figures <a href="#fig131">131</a> and <a href="#fig133">133</a>.)</p>

<p>Professed sisters wear a wedding ring on the
third finger of their right hand. The white outdoor
stiffened hoods often stand right up from the head in
a very striking way, and sometimes no veils are worn.
Some of the caps, which are made in one piece
with the collar, are fastened under the chin by two
strings, and the goffered edges of the collar recall the
bands of the Stuart period.</p>

SUNDAY CLOTHES</h2>

<p class="srt2">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SUNDAY CLOTHES&mdash;THE WEARING
OF HATS IN CHURCH BY LADIES</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Sunday</span> clothes are a time-honoured institution,
though it is a sign of the times that many now
make no difference between their weekday costume
and that which they wear on the day of rest, or if
they do, they only put on garments which are
appropriate to the relaxations in which they are
accustomed to indulge. St. Jerome and St. Clement
both exhorted the early Christian worshippers to
wear a special dress for worship, and the Jews in
their synagogues put on a vestment called a talith,
which is used by the whole of the congregation as
well as by the officiating minister.</p>

<p>We quote the following passage from St. Clement<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
because it deals with the question of women having
their heads covered while at church: &ldquo;The wife
and the husband should take their way unto the
church, in seemly apparel, with unaffected gait, and
speech refrained; having love unfeigned; pure in
body and pure in heart; fitly decked for prayer to
God. And this further let the woman have: let her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
wholly cover her head (unless perchance she be at
home), for so dressed she will have respect and be
withdrawn from gazing eyes. And if thus with
modesty, and with a veil, she covereth her own eyes,
she shall neither be misled herself, nor shall she
draw others, by the exposure of her face, into the
dangerous path of sin. For this willeth the Word;
seeing that it is meet for the woman that she pray
with covered head.... But then so as they, who
are joined to Christ, adorn themselves, in a more
solemn fashion, for assemblies of the church, even
such should they ever be, even so be fashioned, all
the days of their life. &lsquo;To be, not seem to be,&rsquo; let
that be their watchword; gentle, reverent, full of
holy love, at one time not less than at another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is not so, indeed. Somehow doth it come
about, that, with change of place, they change both
their habit and their manners; even as the polypus
is said to change each one his colour to the
semblance of the rock whereby he dwells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It will be remembered that not long ago objection
was taken by a minister to women appearing in his
church without any hats. It would appear that the
whole custom is a relic of that still observed in
eastern countries, where women cover not only
their heads, but also their faces, though, as pointed
out in an earlier chapter (see page <a href="#Page_13">13</a>), in some
places it is still considered more immodest to uncover
the back of the head than to expose any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
part of the person; and in Egypt, for instance, an
Arab woman disturbed when drawing water will
throw her single garment over her head in order to
hide it.</p>

<p>One is rather afraid that those ladies who follow
the lines laid down by St. Clement as to covering
their heads in church sometimes obey his injunctions
in the letter rather than in the spirit. For
scoffers have been found who say that one of the
reasons why fashionable ladies go to church is to
show their own new hats and gowns and to look at
those belonging to their neighbours. The question
of covering the head was touched upon when dealing
with servants&rsquo; dress in connection with the cap of the
housemaid. (See page <a href="#Page_149">149</a>.)</p>

<p>The greatest contrast between Sunday and weekday
clothes is to be looked for in the country among
agricultural labourers, as the cessation of labour
gives an opportunity for discarding the rough and
heavy garments of the field in favour of something
lighter and of better quality, and this quite apart
from the religious idea which no doubt first led to
the practice. Probably the custom of putting on
Sunday clothes in the country will survive until the
rural exodus, which has unfortunately begun, has led
to the complete depopulation of our villages.</p>

ACADEMICAL DRESS</h2>

<p class="srt1">GOWNS AND HANGING SLEEVES&mdash;THE FORERUNNER OF THE
HOOD&mdash;THE ORIGIN OF THE DOCTOR&rsquo;S HAT&mdash;THE EVOLUTION
OF THE MORTAR-BOARD</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Many</span> complaints have been very justly made
against the solemnity, if not the ugliness, of
men&rsquo;s modern evening dress. On important occasions
it may be more or less enlivened by the ribbons
and stars of various orders, but we really get a return
to something of mediÃ¦val brightness at those functions
connected with the universities at which academical
dress is worn. Then the black coats and trousers
are practically hidden, in many cases by scarlet, by
purple, and other coloured gowns. Occasionally
there are combinations of colours which are trying to
the eyes of many, but on the whole the effect is one
that is pleasing and worthy of repetition. Academical
dress is in itself a survival, and the gay colours
are almost enough to tell us this. Records exist
which show that in the fifteenth century they were
already adopted by the graduates of our universities.</p>

<p>The evidence which has been brought forward as
to the origin of academic costume points to its having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
been derived from that of the clergy; but there are
interesting connections with civil dress, as we shall
see. One of the special features of many academic
gowns is their long hanging sleeves, and we shall
find that so long ago as the time of William Rufus
sleeves had grown so long that it had become convenient
to make a hole through them through which
the hand and forearm could be protruded. (See
Figure <a href="#fig134">134</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 16em;"><a id="fig134"></a>
<img src="images/fig134.png" width="174" height="357" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 134.</span>&mdash;Hanging sleeve of the fifteenth century.</p>
</div></div>

<p>These sleeves took upon themselves all sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
forms, and they were made so long and narrow that
they resembled very much the elongation of the hood
which was called a liripipe. Occasionally it was
found necessary to knot them so that they should not
trail upon the ground. Very few parts of dress have
varied so much as sleeves, and it is said that any
costume can be dated by an examination of the
sleeves. Nowadays, as in the past, the length of the
sleeve and of the gown itself indicates the status of
the member of the university. At Oxford, for instance,
the undergraduate&rsquo;s gown is so short that it
is hardly worthy of the name, and it is without
sleeves that act as such. The scholar&rsquo;s gown is more
voluminous, and the gowns of the bachelors and
masters of arts are more important again, while the
sleeves belonging to the latter reach nearly to the
ground.</p>

<p>When we come, however, to the robes of the
Chancellor, which are made of stiffer material, we
find that the ancient character of the hanging sleeves
is much more marked (see Figure <a href="#fig135">135</a>), and there is
a train so long that small pages are told off to
support it. In the old days, the material of which
the gowns were made, and their trimmings indicated
the rank of the wearers; and, as Mr. Druitt<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
points out, the bachelor, for instance, was unable to
use fur of so costly a kind as that worn by his
academical superiors. Stuff or silk gowns still have
their significance, and in the hoods which are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
survival of a part of dress which was once useful and
worn by graduates and undergraduates alike, we find
great diversity in the case of the various degrees of
different universities.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 16em;"><a id="fig135"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 135.</span>&mdash;The hanging sleeve of a Chancellor of
Oxford University.</p>
</div></div>

<p>As a head covering, the cap took the place of a
hood, and the latter fell down behind like that often
seen on a modern ulster. We have already noticed
(p. <a href="#Page_157">157</a>) how this peak of the hood was exaggerated,
and in old times the liripipe was longer in the case of
undergraduates. The modern hood of the universities
has grown in size, but it has lost its long streamer.
Examples are, of course, most commonly seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
churches, as it is a custom of the clergy to wear
their academical hoods over their white surplices.
The colour of the hood and of its lining indicates,
to the initiated, the university to which the wearer
belongs, and the degree which he has taken.</p>

<p>In early times a tippet or cape made of fur or cloth
edged or lined with fur, according to the degree, was
also worn. To this we have alluded when speaking
of the surplice (see page <a href="#Page_199">199</a>). It seems also to have
originally been a kind of hood which developed first
into the almuce, one of the processional vestments of
the priesthood. This was covered by the ecclesiastical
cope, but was worn outside the academical gown.
Doctors of Divinity were allowed to wear scarlet
tippets, and the colour survives now in their academical
hood, and the ordinary black almuce with its fur
lining has not been greatly changed in becoming the
hood of the Bachelor of Arts.</p>

<p>Sometimes the tippet and sometimes the hood was
worn (if we may judge from monumental brasses), but
also they were both put on at the same time. The
figure of a doctor embroidered on a fifteenth-century
cope belonging to the Pro-Cathedral of the Apostles
at Clifton, depicts him wearing a tippet edged with
white, a red hood, and a red cap. His gown, which
is worked in gold thread, is shown with a blue lining.</p>

<p>Perhaps no form of head-dress is more strange
than the college cap or mortar-board, or, in technical
language, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pileus quadratus</i>, or cater cap. This skull-cap,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
with its curious square top, is not the only kind
of academical head-dress. There is the round cap
which is especially that of the doctor, while the mortar-board
or trencher already mentioned is used by
masters and bachelors, as well as by undergraduates
and scholars. The former head-dress seems to have
been very little altered, and was developed somewhere
about the fourteenth century or earlier from the ecclesiastical
skull-cap, which was something like an old-fashioned
man&rsquo;s nightcap, with a tuft. The square
cap is an undoubted descendant of the ecclesiastical
cap of dignity, and in England this also came from
the skull-cap already mentioned. Towards the end
of the fifteenth century, while still used by ecclesiastics,
it began to assume a square or cusped
shape. Prof. E.&nbsp;C. Clark<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> agrees with the opinion
expressed to him by the late Dr. Littledale, that folds
were introduced into the soft material in order to
make the cap easier to hold, for by them it was
stiffened. The folds became four wings, and so converted
the round top into a square. From this it was
but a short step to the ecclesiastical biretta of the
present day. Any further exaggeration of its top
would cause the cap to fall down on the face, and
would naturally suggest the insertion of something
to stiffen it and hold it out, and in the end the square
top of the cap was made of cardboard covered with
cloth, and a skull-cap was fixed to it underneath.

<p>There is a likeness between the round hat of the
doctor and the Tudor flat cap, and Fairholt would
derive the mortar-board from the same head-dress;
and as illustrating the story of its evolution, he compares
the cap shown in the portrait of Cranmer (see
Figure <a href="#fig137">137</a>) in the British Museum with that of a
bishop of the time of Charles&nbsp;I (see Figure <a href="#fig138">138</a>);
and here again the need for stiffening is obvious, if
the enlargement of the crown of the cap be carried
any further.</p>

LEGAL DRESS</h2>

<p class="srt2">VESTIGES OF THE COIF&mdash;HOODS AND GOWNS&mdash;SIGNS OF
MOURNING</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> would be strange if the majesty of the law did
not depend to some extent upon dress, and there
is no doubt but that an impressiveness which would
otherwise be absent from our courts is given by wigs
and gowns. The wigs themselves are an interesting
survival, and presumably are not more uncomfortable
to the few who now wear them than they were to
many in times gone by. We will describe here a few
interesting vestiges among those which are to be
met with in legal costume.</p>

<p>Any one who has an opportunity of looking on to
the top of a judge&rsquo;s wig will notice a small circular
depression about three inches across. (See Figure
<a href="#fig139">139</a>.) This has a very interesting history, and in
order to trace it we shall have to look at the long
wigs of the serjeants-at-law, from whose ranks in the
past most of the judges used to come. On the
serjeant&rsquo;s wig we shall find that there is a similar
depression, and that it is filled with a circular white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
patch, having a black centre, and reminding one of
two large pieces of court plaster, one stuck over the
other. (See Figure <a href="#fig140">140</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 14em;"><a id="fig139"></a>
<img src="images/fig139.png" width="143" height="268" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 139.</span>&mdash;The wig of a modern judge.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The white piece represents the coif, or close-fitting
cap of white lawn or silk which resembles that of a
nun, and with which the serjeants-at-law on their
creation were decked. From this cap, the body to
which the serjeants-at-law belonged was called the
Order of the Coif. It seems that the origin of this
head-dress cannot definitely be settled. Mr. Druitt<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
and Mr. Paley Baildon are content to consider it
as part of the insignia of the serjeants-at-law, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the same way that the round cap indicates the
possessor of a doctor&rsquo;s degree, and they are not
inclined to give credence to the suggestion that the
coif was to hide the tonsure or to prevent its absence
from being noticed. The black patch represents a
black skull-cap that was worn over the coif.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;"><a id="fig140"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 140.</span>&mdash;The vestige of the coif from the wig of a serjeant-at-law.</p>
</div></div>

<p>After having been in existence for many hundreds
of years, the order of serjeants-at-law was abolished
by Mr. Gladstone. Lord Lindley, we believe, is
the last member who survives. A black skull-cap is
also worn by a judge, but it is not to be confounded
with the cap of dignity which is used by him when
pronouncing sentence, and which was ordered to be
worn in church when on circuit. Ordinarily, the
judge does not wear his scarlet gown, but a black
one, the girdle of which has grown to a very great
width.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The drab colour of the trimmings, which does not
harmonize well with the rest of the gown, has
recently begun to give way to primrose, and the
change is due to the initiative of the late Lord
Coleridge.</p>

<p>It is said that black gowns which are worn by
the King&rsquo;s Counsel and other barristers superseded
the coloured ones on the death of Queen Mary&nbsp;II,
and in reality were intended as mourning which has
never been discarded. Legal gowns have come down
with very little change from the Middle Ages, and are
doubtless derived from ecclesiastical through academical
costume. The original robes of the serjeants-at-law
were somewhat striking in colour, for taking a
line down the centre of the black, one half was of a
mustard colour and the other red, while the latter
was further ornamented with green stripes. The
robe of the Barons of the Exchequer was of a
beautiful heliotrope tint.</p>

<p>The material of the gown of the King&rsquo;s Counsel
is indicated by the phrase &ldquo;taking silk.&rdquo; One
peculiarity of the garment is that it has a large collar
resembling that of court-ushers and of vergers in
churches. The ordinary dress of the King&rsquo;s Counsel
which he wears in court is interesting on account of
the ornamental cuffs and the escalloped flaps of the
pockets of the coat and waistcoat, which resemble
those of Court dress.</p>

</div></div>

<p>On the barrister&rsquo;s gown there is a tiny hood on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
left shoulder resembling that from which the chaperon
was developed, and from the vestige runs a streamer
which comes over the left shoulder and hangs down
in front of the gown. (See Figure <a href="#fig141">141</a>.) There is
also a series of buttons as well as pieces of braid
on the sleeves which are survivals, and we have not
the hanging sleeves of the King&rsquo;s Counsel, which are
comparable to those seen in many academic gowns.
Small falling bands are of course generally worn by
members of the legal profession, and barristers and
King&rsquo;s Counsel when in mourning have a little pleat
down the middle of each band. Perhaps the most
curious additions to legal costume used in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
indicate mourning are the little white lawn or muslin
cuffs, like those of widows, which the King&rsquo;s Counsel
wear on their sleeves when the Court is in mourning,
or when they themselves have suffered bereavement.</p>

STATE AND COURT ATTIRE</h2>

<p class="srt1">CORONATION DRESS&mdash;PARLIAMENTARY ROBES&mdash;MISTAKES IN
COURT DRESS&mdash;VESTIGES OF THE WIG AND OF THE
CHAPERON&mdash;COURT CARDS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> English sovereigns are heads of the Church
as well as of the State, and in connection with
their coronation dress there are, as might be expected,
many survivals from the past. The vestments used
on the occasion in question agree almost entirely
with those which we have described as being worn by
a bishop at mass.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> We may except, however, the
amice and the maniple, while the sceptre and crown
take the place of the crosier and the mitre. The first
vestment to be put on is of linen, and is an albe or
rochet, and up to the time of James&nbsp;II it was provided
with sleeves&mdash;it is known as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colobium
sindonis</i>. Over this is placed the tunicle or dalmatic.
This is made of silk, and across it is worn the stole
in the same way as deacons were ordered to do in the
year 561. The custom is still followed in Greece and
Rome, whereas priests generally put on the stole
immediately after the albe.</p>

<p>Over the dalmatic comes the imperial mantle which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
seems to have been originally a chasuble, but is now
slit up in front. This garment, which is of cloth of
gold, is embroidered with eagles, that are interesting
as probably representing the claim of the King
of England to be Emperor of Britain and Lord Paramount
over all the Islands of the West. In Charles&nbsp;II&rsquo;s
reign further ornaments occurred in the shape of roses
and fleur-de-lys, and on Queen Victoria&rsquo;s mantle there
were roses, half red and half white, as well as thistles,
shamrocks, and fleur-de-lys, while the eagles were
embroidered in silver.</p>

<p>At the coronation of King Edward&nbsp;VII the vestments
which we have described were all used with
the exception of the albe, and to the other devices on
the imperial mantle the lotus flower was added as a
symbol for India, as the King was the first sovereign
to be crowned as Emperor of India.</p>

<p>The robe which the King wears at the opening
of Parliament has a cape of ermine made up in
miniver style, and it is lined throughout with the
same fur. We might here say that ordinary ermine
is decorated with the tails of the stoat, which remain
black when this animal puts on its winter dress,
whereas in the case of miniver the fur is spotted all
over with little black pieces made from the skin
of some other animal. This has not always been the
same, but at the present time Persian lamb is used.</p>

<p>The magnificence of the King&rsquo;s parliamentary robe
and its train of crimson velvet may be gathered from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the fact that in the making of the miniver, upwards
of ten thousand pieces of black fur were used. In
a portrait of the King, taken when wearing this robe,
he is shown in the uniform of a Field Marshal, and
holds in his hand the Field Marshal&rsquo;s baton. The
latter originally was a box in which the general
carried the orders of his sovereign, and it is rather
curious that what was once the emblem of the
servant should come to be used by a crowned head
himself.</p>

<p>The rank of noblemen is indicated on their parliamentary
robes by the number of bands of ermine
with which they are decorated. A Baron has two,
a Viscount two and a half, an Earl three, a Marquis
three and a half, and a Duke four, whereas on their
coronation robes the same effect is gained by a
similar number of rows of black spots on the miniver,
which forms a kind of cape.</p>

<p>As in connection with life at Court there are a
number of special uniforms and official dresses
which are carefully prescribed, it is likely that we
should find among the dress of those surrounding
the sovereign, many and excellent examples of survivals.
There is, indeed, one uniform which has
come down to us practically unaltered from the year
1485. This is the dress worn by the Yeomen of the
Guard, who may be looked upon as the King&rsquo;s
Retainers. (See Figure <a href="#fig142">142</a>.)</p>

<p>It is an obvious example of the point that we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
dwelt upon in connection with badges and liveries,
for borne on the back and chest are the royal crown
and initials. Of course, the latter have altered from
time to time, and when the King came to the throne
the Tudor crown, which had been superseded by that
of St. Edward, was replaced.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The development of the badges on the coat is
interesting. In Henry&nbsp;VII&rsquo;s reign there was the
crown and the red and white rose. In the time
of Anne the thistle was added, and the rose was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
placed upon a stalk. The Tudor crown was also
replaced, for during the Stuart period, St. Edward&rsquo;s
crown had appeared, and the royal motto was added.
In the Georgian period St. Edward&rsquo;s crown again
was made use of, while George&nbsp;III added the shamrock.
Now, in King Edward&nbsp;VII&rsquo;s time, we have
the Tudor crown, the rose, thistle, and shamrock,
the motto &ldquo;Dieu et mon droit,&rdquo; and the initials
&ldquo;E.R.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What the original uniform was, is not quite certain,
but practically the same kind of coat was worn in
Henry&nbsp;VIII&rsquo;s reign that appears now. The ruff would
appear to be Elizabethan, though the hat is earlier.
The officers used to wear a similar but more gorgeous
uniform, but when William&nbsp;IV commanded that
only officers of the army should be given commissions
in the Guard, the present dress, which is that of a
field officer of the Peninsular period, was introduced.
When King Edward&nbsp;VII came to the throne he left
the decision as to whether they should wear the old
Tudor dress, to the officers themselves, and they
decided in favour of the more modern military one.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
We might mention the halberds that are carried by
the Yeomen, and also allude to some of the duties
which they have carried out, from the making of the
King&rsquo;s bed in early times to searching the Houses
of Parliament before the session opens, which is a
memory of Guy Fawkes, and of attending, as they
have done for centuries, at the giving of alms by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the sovereign in Westminster Abbey on Maundy
Thursday.</p>

<p>Very many uniforms seen at Court show the turned-back
edges and the lining of the tails, described when
we were dealing with the evolution of the coat (see
p. <a href="#Page_34">34</a>)&mdash;for instance, in the case of the gentlemen-at-arms,
and of several officials. We may mention also
the Scottish Archers who wear a green coat with a
turned-back part&mdash;which represents the lining&mdash;of
red velvet.</p>

<p>The style of Court dress which may be worn to-day
by civilians has become somewhat simpler, though
ruffles and frills are still to be found in connection,
and may be worn with, what is known as old-style
dress that is always adopted by the legal profession.
The knee-breeches come from the time of William&nbsp;III,
and the coat in its original form dates back to the
time of Napoleon. The sides of the coat have, however,
been cut away, and this was done during the
last reign, when the alteration was made for the convenience
of those who were not accustomed to wear
a sword.</p>

<p>The more recent simplification of Court dress has,
however, provided pitfalls for the unwary, and all
sorts of curious mistakes in small details are made.
To show how easy it is to put a button too many
here, or too few there, we may describe the differences
between the old and new styles. On the old
there are seven buttons up the front of the coat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
three on the cuffs. In the new, there are but six in
the first case and none in the second. Again, in the
simplified coat there are no buttons below the flaps
(which represent pockets), and but four buttons
behind on the tails. In the old style there are three
buttons below the flaps&mdash;while there are similar ornaments
on the waistcoat, which is skirted&mdash;and there
are six buttons on the tails. Then in addition there
is the wig-bag, to which we shall refer in a moment,
at the back of the coat collar, as well as the frills
and ruffles. Although on the lace of these as much
may be spent as on the rest of the costume, the cost
of the simpler dress is really not much less than that
of the other. A survival is, of course, to be seen in
the sword and in the simplified costume, it is worn in
a frog instead of on a sling.</p>

<p>We have made it evident how much a man now
depends upon his tailor for correctness in the detail
of his Court dress, and it is amusing to find that wig-bags
are put on to modern-style coats, and that the
number of buttons is often quite wrong; but if these
are the faults of the tailor, it is the man himself who
is responsible who goes to Court with his sword hanging
at his right side. We have not heard of military
men making such a mistake, but officers have been
known to appear with their cross-belts over the
wrong shoulder. It is a good thing for some that
Court etiquette is not so strict as it has been in
the past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>A curious survival is found in connection with old-style
dress and some of the uniforms which are worn
by officials, and we have had to mention similar
vestiges when speaking of the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s coachman
and of the Welsh Fusiliers. This is what is known
as a wig-bag (see Figures <a href="#fig109">109</a> and <a href="#fig113">113</a>), though in the
Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s descriptions it is now referred to
by the same name as the ornament of somewhat similar
origin of the Welsh Fusiliers, namely, the &ldquo;flash.&rdquo;
It consists of a small bag of silk, at the bottom
corners of which little satin ribbon loops are fixed,
while the whole is covered by an elaborate rosette
of satin ribbon, and is suspended from the back of
the coat collar. The bag represents the old bag in
which the bob of the wig was placed, and the loops
no doubt are those through which a ribbon was
passed, which went round the neck of those who
wore wigs, and was secured by a jewel on the breast.
This was to provide against the wig being lost,
should it fall from the head of its wearer, for these
curious replacements of natural hair were of considerable
value, costing twenty, thirty, sixty or even
more guineas. The rosette of ribbon is the modern
representative of the bow that tied the wig. (See
Figure <a href="#fig143">143</a>.)</p>

<p>We have already traced the connection which Mr.
Calthrop has shown between the cockade and the
chaperon, and we might mention again that this
ancient form of head-dress survives in connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
with the hood of the mantle of the Knights of the
Garter and of other Orders, for instance, those of St.
Patrick and of the Thistle. (See Figure <a href="#fig144">144</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;"><a id="fig143"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 143.</span>&mdash;The wig-bag or &ldquo;flash&rdquo; from a Court suit, showing the rosette
held away and displaying the black silk bag. At the lower
corners of the latter loops are seen, which are probably the
remains of those through which a ribbon was passed, which went
round the neck and fastened on the breast by a brooch.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the case of the Knight of the Garter, the hood
consists of a flat piece of crimson velvet about three-quarters
of a yard across, slightly oval in shape, and
at a spot a little on one side of the centre is to
be found the remains of the turban of the chaperon.
It is a thick ring covered outside with crimson velvet,
and inside with white silk. To one side of this is
fastened a long band of crimson velvet one and
three-quarter times as long as the hood is wide. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
represents, of course, the liripipe of the chaperon.
(See page <a href="#Page_166">166</a> and Figures <a href="#fig122-123">122</a>-<a href="#fig124-125">125</a>.) The edges of
the velvet in all cases are ornamented with a white silk
piping. The hood is fixed on the right shoulder, and
the band representing the liripipe is brought across
the breast of the wearer. In addition there are some
wide loops and ends of ribbon called the streamer,
and narrow ribbons with which to fasten the structure
to the mantle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;"><a id="fig144"></a>
<img src="images/fig144.png" width="129" height="271" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 144.</span>&mdash;The hood from the mantle of a Knight of the Garter,
showing the survival of the chaperon and its liripipe.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The hoods of the Orders of the Thistle and of
St. Patrick are similar in construction, and in the
case of the former the velvet of which they are
made is blue in colour. On the mantles of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Orders only the streamer remains. On the left shoulder
of the Knights of the Bath and of St. Michael
and St. George there is a small vestige of aiguillettes.
This is of silk cord in the former case, and of gold
cord in the second. The under-dress, which is not
commonly worn now, is furnished with trunk hose
and silk tights, and from its appearance is known as
the silver dress. Much the same style was carried
out in all the Orders that we have up to the present
had occasion to mention. In the more modern
Orders there is, of course, no such ancient under-dress.</p>

<p>If we have Kings and Queens at Court, we also have
Kings and Queens and Knaves among our playing-cards,
and the costumes which survive on the curious
pictures which represent them in double, but without
their lower limbs, are worthy of some little attention.
As a matter of fact, they are Tudor dresses, slightly
modified perhaps of recent years, but nevertheless,
a common and widespread relic of the fashions which
were in vogue when Henry&nbsp;VIII was going through
his matrimonial troubles, and shaking this country
clear from its allegiance to the Pope.</p>

<p>There are two series of ceremonial dresses not
immediately connected with the State which it may
be worth while to investigate. They are, in the first
place, the liveries of the City Companies, and in the
second the insignia of Masons. In the first case, on
some of the gowns we find again the chaperon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
appearing as a hood on the shoulder, and many of the
caps that are worn have survived for some centuries.
A few of the companies still possess their ancient
embroidered hearse cloths, which recall the early
semi-religious and provident purposes of the guilds
out of which the great City Companies have developed.</p>

<p>There seems no doubt, too, but that the apron of the
Masons is actually derived from that worn by the
craftsmen when at work, and in some countries it is
still of the same circular form as those which were used
by the English masons of the eighteenth century.
Other parts of the clothing of Masons are no doubt
derived from the old guild liveries, and in the fact
that some high officials wear gauntlets we have a
reminder of the knights&rsquo; armour, and possibly a survival
from the time when high officials were knights.</p>

SURVIVALS IN MILITARY UNIFORMS</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> cuirass of the Household troops which they
wear on important occasions, as well as the
metal helmets of various regiments, are survivals
from the time when armour was of use, and if we
examine the shoulders of certain soldiers, we shall
find that there are vestiges of chain mail, though now
this only takes the place of epaulettes. (See Figure <a href="#fig145">145</a>.)
To see chain mail in its perfection we must go back
to the time of Edward&nbsp;I, and if we look, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
at the brass of Sir John D&rsquo;Aubernoun (who died in
the year 1277) or of Sir Richard de Trumpington,
<span class="f8">A.D.</span> 1289 (see Figure <a href="#fig146">146</a>), which are the earliest
remaining in this country, we shall find that the chain
mail now represented by a little patch on the shoulder
then covered the head and neck, arms and hands,
body, feet and legs.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 145.</span>&mdash;Relic of chain mail on the shoulder of an Imperial Yeoman.</p>
</div></div>

<p>As time went on, plate armour was mixed with the
mail, until at last, in the time of Henry&nbsp;IV, we get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
complete plate period in which there was a breastplate
and a corresponding back plate, which had already appeared
in the period of transition of chain mail to
plate armour. From thence onward the development
of armour progressed until it gradually disappeared.
In Stuart times, jack boots and spur leathers took the
place of the armour on the legs, and a buff coat that
on the body, with the exception of a gorget. This
came to be in the early part of the nineteenth century,
merely a small badge of the officer on duty, and in a
still more diminished form is to be seen in some
foreign armies.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In the earlier part of the book it was made evident
that military uniforms afford a fine field for research,
though apart from the remains of armour, however,
they are comparatively modern. It was not, indeed,
until the reign of Charles&nbsp;II that we meet with
uniforms regularly adopted by the Army; and the red
coat which has given its name to the soldier, though
many regiments are dressed in other colours, was
previous to that time merely a best coat. We see it
now on fox-hunters and golfers, though a long coat
of this colour is still worn by the King&rsquo;s footmen and
coachmen. A writer in the <cite>Spectator</cite>, No. 129, says,
when speaking of Cornwall: &ldquo;Here we fancied ourselves
in Charles&nbsp;II&rsquo;s reign, people having made
little variation in their dress since that time. The
smartest of the country squires appear still in the
Monmouth cock; when they go a-wooing (whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
they have any post in the militia or not) they put on
a red coat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There had previous to the Restoration been some
attempt to introduce uniform dress for soldiers quite
apart from the sovereign&rsquo;s special guards, who, after
the fashion of retainers, wore his livery. For instance,
the Duke of Norfolk, in the reign of Henry&nbsp;VIII,
issued instructions that every soldier should wear a
blue coat guarded with red, the right hose to be red,
the left blue, and a red stripe three fingers broad
down the outside of each leg. The archers are
described as wearing white gaberdines, at one time
in this reign, while in 1576 those belonging to Ireland
had a cassock of blue cloth with two small white
guards. Red coats as well as others of blue or
white were worn by the English troops in Turenne&rsquo;s
army in 1657, and examples of the last two colours
are by no means extinct in the army to-day. Red,
blue, grey, and green, it may be added, were all worn
during the Civil War on both sides.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten, however, that gay uniforms
are now only used at home in times of peace,
for we have learnt a lesson from the lower animals,
many of which are protectively coloured, and the
service uniform to-day is one calculated to render its
wearer as inconspicuous as possible. Before the time
of firearms which could be used with precision, and
when hand-to-hand combats played a great part in
war, it was necessary for two adversaries to be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
to see one another, but now each tries to hide himself.</p>

<p>Some years ago a sketch, which was made from a
cavalry man at Aldershot, was given in the <cite>Daily
Mail</cite>; side by side was shown another taken from
a print representing one of Cromwell&rsquo;s Ironsides, and
the likeness between the two is almost exact. (See
Figure <a href="#fig147">147</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Ornamental epaulettes may also be looked upon as
the last remnant of armour, though the modern kind
probably came from a shoulder-knot of Charles&nbsp;II&rsquo;s
time, as they were originally intended to protect the
shoulders from sword-thrusts. At the present day,
though they are worn in the English Navy and are
common on the Continent, they have practically disappeared
from the Army.</p>

<p>The officers of the Yeomen of the Guard, whose
uniform is that which was worn in the Peninsular
War, still wear epaulettes, as do the Gentlemen-at-Arms
and the Lords-Lieutenant of Counties. As
we have said, there is a fine field for the study of
survivals in uniforms proper, and from time to time
many of these have attracted the notice of popular
writers.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> <sup>&amp;</sup> <a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>Additional interest is given to this subject by the
fact that besides the variations which have gradually
evolved, there are special features which have suddenly
appeared often in connection with some important
battle, which we might liken to the curious
sports and freaks which sometimes occur in the
natural history world.</p>

<p>When, in 1881, the old regimental facings were
abolished, many distinctions vanished, still there are
more curious details left than we shall be able to
describe. We have already seen how the busby was
derived from the Hungarian cap, and quite a number
of other features have been introduced from foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
countries. The square cap of the Lancer is the
national head-dress of the Poles, who call it a shapka,
and the uniform itself came from Poland. The sling
jacket or dolman of the Hussars (see Figure <a href="#fig082">82</a>),
which is now extinct in our army, was also an introduction,
but still on the pouch-belt of Light Cavalry
officers are the prickers fastened with silver chains,
which were used with old flint-lock muzzle-loaders.
(See Figure <a href="#fig148">148</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;"><a id="fig148"></a>
<img src="images/fig148.png" width="224" height="296" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 148.</span>&mdash;The prickers on the shoulder-belt of a Hussar, which survive
from the time of flint-lock muskets.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Some of these interesting but useless instruments are
furnished with plain round knobs, but others made as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
if they were arrows with feathered shafts. Mr. Caton
Woodville gives the following explanation of the
aiguillettes worn by aides-de-camp. He says that
&ldquo;they date from the days when the war-horses, or
chargers, were of solid build and slow of movement,
and when only the adjutants were mounted on fleet
steeds. Then the head-dress was a heavy three-cornered
hat perched on a wig that was itself often
not too securely fastened to its wearer&rsquo;s head. He
needed, therefore, a cord with metal tags passing
round the brim and under the loops which upheld its
three sides. It was fastened to the officer&rsquo;s shoulder,
as the weight of the felt hat, with its bars of steel
as a protection against sword cuts, was considerable,
and it was enough to choke a man if it should
happen to dangle from his throat, so the aiguillettes
have become the distinguished mark of the
assistant to the general commanding in the field or
garrison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It should, however, be mentioned also that these
ornaments are worn in the Household Cavalry by
non-commissioned officers, and are a relic there of
the days when these soldiers were gentlemen of the
Royal Life Guards, who had the right to a commission
in a line regiment after a certain number
of years&rsquo; service. Other soldiers carry them, as do
also the footmen of the nobility. Horse soldiers
have also an ornamental cord to their head-dresses,
and it seems likely that the aiguillettes had another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
origin, and that prickers or some other instruments
were at one time attached to them.</p>

<p>In the Lancers there is a very long cap-line, which
has been mixed up, we are told by Mr. P.&nbsp;W.
Reynolds, with a very interesting survival. This is
the remains of a cord used for binding up grass and
other forage into bundles, worn for convenience round
the body, and over one shoulder by cavalry men, when
it was not in use. It is known to the French as a
&ldquo;fourragÃ¨re.&rdquo; In the Lancers the cap-line passes
round the cap and is brought under the right shoulder-strap.
So far it is the original cap-line; then it passes
twice round the body, under the left arm, and under
the right shoulder-strap, and ends, in a festoon
and a couple of acorns, which remind one of aiguillettes,
on the left breast. The part that goes round
the body is the old forage cord.</p>

<p>The sergeants&rsquo; sashes, it is said, were originally
intended to make slings so that the wounded could be
carried out of action with the help of pikes, and the
drum-major&rsquo;s baton is the survival of a cane which
the drill-sergeant sometimes used on the backs of
the recruits. The &ldquo;flash&rdquo; of the Welsh Fusiliers,
as we have seen, is a survival from the times when
wigs were worn. Here and there we find old head-dresses
once nearly universal, such as the shako
which is now confined to the Highland Light Infantry
and the Scottish Rifles. Other regiments, such
as those of the Rifle Brigade, which have been at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
times used as cavalry, retain certain features of the
horse soldier&rsquo;s uniform. For instance, the Rifle
Brigade has a head-dress which resembles the
Hussars&rsquo; busby, and instead of a sash the officers
wear a cross-belt.</p>

<p>The officers of the Somersetshire Light Infantry,
which on one occasion was turned into cavalry at a
moment&rsquo;s notice, wear a mess jacket of the cavalry
pattern; they have also a black worm in their lace,
like the East Yorkshire and North Lancashire regiments,
which is usually explained as being mourning
for Sir John Moore in the first case, and for General
Wolfe in the two others. Before turning to peculiarities
which were granted for special services, we may
mention the black tunics and black plumes of the
farriers belonging to the Life Guards, who carry a
great axe with which to kill horses that are wounded
in battle, and the state trumpeters also of the Household
Cavalry, who wear a highly ornamental uniform
which has persisted for nearly two centuries.</p>

<p>There still remain relics of the time when commanding
officers had a great deal to say in connection
with the uniforms of their regiments. When the
Cameron Highlanders were first raised in 1794,
Colonel Cameron did not adopt the Cameron tartan,
because he did not think it would go well with a
scarlet tunic, and he introduced one which had been
designed by his mother, called the &ldquo;Cameron
Erracht,&rdquo; which has been worn ever since. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
White Horse of Hanover appears as a badge on
several regiments, and it is recorded that George&nbsp;I,
objecting to the private crests of the commanding
officers, replaced them in many cases with the
Hanoverian device. Even now, in spite of the minute
regulations of the War Office, which are continually
being altered, the uniforms are not always made
absolutely as they are prescribed. Little details
may be added, and colonels still seem to exercise
some influence in the matter. The red puggaree
of the Duke of Cornwall&rsquo;s Light Infantry is not
obtained from the regimental tailor who supplies the
uniform.</p>

<p>The white jackets of the Guards and Highland
corps which are worn in undress are still called
&ldquo;waistcoats,&rdquo; and, according to Mr. Walter Wood, are
a relic of the white waistcoat which was worn under
the tunic by the British soldiers down to the time
of William&nbsp;IV. It must, however, be remembered
that a waistcoat was originally an outer garment, as
indicated on page <a href="#Page_148">148</a>.</p>

<p>An exceedingly curious privilege is that which
has been accorded to the non-commissioned officers
and men of the Royal Marines, who for many years
have been allowed when in mourning, to cover one
button of their tunics with crape. The Eighth
Hussars wear their sword-belts over their shoulders,
and the tradition is that at the battle of Saragossa
they behaved so gallantly that they totally destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
a corps of Spanish cavalry and took possession of
their adversaries&rsquo; belts.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most curious mark of distinction is the
extra drummer of the Third Hussars, who enjoys
special pay and is permitted to wear a sergeant&rsquo;s
uniform. This privilege was granted by George&nbsp;III
when it was brought to his notice that the regiment
possessed some silver kettledrums which they had
captured. The request for this honour was made in
1778 by General Fitzroy, and his wife presented a
silver collar for the use of the additional drummer
which is still worn to-day. It is handsomely engraved
with military devices, and fits closely round
the throat. In full dress the Eleventh Hussars wear
an ivory-hilted sword made on the model of one
picked up at Bhurtpore. The Fifteenth Hussars
wear the Austrian Imperial lace on account of their
gallantry at Villiers-en-Couche, which prevented the
Emperor of Austria from falling a prisoner to the
French.</p>

<p>The Scots Greys were given Grenadier caps, which
are not worn by other cavalry regiments, for their
bravery at Ramillies. The Northumberland Fusiliers
have red and white hackle feathers&mdash;that is to say, that
the upper part of their plume is red, and the lower
part white. It is recorded that at Wilhelmstahl, and
also when in St. Lucia, this regiment was victorious
after great struggles, and took from the caps of the
French Grenadiers who were slain, enough white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
feathers to fit up the whole regiment with plumes, the
use of which afterwards received official sanction.
When, however, an order was made in 1829 that
white plumes should be generally worn, the Fusiliers
complained that they would lose the distinction which
they enjoyed, and by a compromise they were allowed
to have a plume which was half red and half white.
The Northumberland Fusiliers share with one or two
other regiments, that distinguished themselves at the
battle of Minden, the privilege of wearing roses in
their caps on St. George&rsquo;s Day.</p>

<p>We might spend a considerable time in dealing
with the badges of various regiments, for often the
history of the latter is bound up with them. They
figure on the collar and other parts of the uniform,
and occasionally, as badges might be expected to do,
they appear on the buttons. We have touched upon
this subject in connection with George&nbsp;I. The Scots
Greys have as a badge an eagle with outstretched
wings. It commemorates the capture of a French
eagle at Waterloo by Sergeant Ewart, who was given
a commission for his bravery.</p>

<p>The Gloucestershire Regiment has a badge in front
and another on the back of the helmets, because on
one occasion, in Egypt, when it was attacked in
the rear as well as in front by large bodies of French
cavalry, and there was no time to form a square, the
commanding officer gave the order, &ldquo;Rear rank, right
about face, fire!&rdquo; The result was that the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
was beaten off. In connection with this achievement
the second badge was given.</p>

<p>An interesting tale is told with regard to the formation
of the Guards by Charles&nbsp;II after the Restoration.
There were three regiments present, and they were
commanded to take up arms as the First, Second, and
Third Guards, but while the first and third obeyed
the order, General Monk&rsquo;s regiment stood still. The
King, who was surprised at the apparent insubordination,
asked Monk for the reason. Whereupon he
said that his regiment declined to be considered
second to any other. As a result, Charles is said to
have answered, &ldquo;Very well, they shall be my Coldstream
Regiment of Foot Guards, and second to
none.&rdquo; From this comes their motto, &ldquo;Nulli secundus.&rdquo;
It may be mentioned, also, that this regiment
has a distinction which is absolutely unique in the
Army, as it bears on the King&rsquo;s colour a small Union
Jack, which commemorates the fact that Monk was an
Admiral of the Fleet as well as a General.</p>

<p>It is only about a hundred years since the pretensions
of the English sovereigns to the throne
of France ceased to be evident, for it was not until
the end of George&nbsp;III&rsquo;s reign that the French
fleur-de-lys were removed from the Royal Arms and
disappeared from our coins. There is still, however,
a survival of the lilies of France on the braid
of the drummers in the Guards. White lace with red
crowns is what is almost universally worn by drummers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
in the Army, but the crown is replaced in the
case mentioned by the fleur-de-lys. Whilst speaking
of the Guards, one may recall that not very long ago
a uniform was used by the solicitor with which these
soldiers were, and in the case of the Coldstream
Guards are still, provided. The solicitor, like the
medical officer, wore the cocked hat that is now
dying out in the Army, though generals and aides-de-camp
still adopt this most curious outcome of the
Cavalier&rsquo;s beaver. Here and there, as in the case
of the surgeon and veterinary surgeon of the Life
Guards, and the medical officers of some Volunteer
regiments, we still see the cocked hat. It flourishes
also in Court dress, it adorns the Lords-Lieutenant
and their deputies, besides maintaining its position
among the officers of the Navy.</p>

<p>Fur, the material of which the first clothes of our
ancestors were made, is still seen to a considerable
extent in the Army, and is chiefly used for the construction
of busbies. So important was the trade in furs
for military purposes at one time, that bear-skins were
classified as follows: &ldquo;Officers,&rdquo; or first grade;
&ldquo;Grenadiers,&rdquo; or second grade; and &ldquo;unfit for the
Army,&rdquo; or third grade. Like all features of dress
which are exaggerated, the big busbies of the Guards
have on more than one occasion afforded material for
the caricaturist. Leech depicted the soldiers of the
Brigade of Guards warming their hands and feet in
their busbies, which they used as muffs; and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
amusing series of sketches for the amusement of the
young people was published not long ago, in which
the soldier disappeared almost entirely into his busby
and became a sort of Humpty-Dumpty.</p>

<p>Tall hats of the type of our modern silk hats were
not unknown in the Army. Perhaps it may come as
a shock to some that Lord Howard of Effingham is
shown in a portrait as wearing a top hat, in shape
very similar to the modern form, but ornamented with
a plume of ostrich feathers. There is, we believe,
however, still one top hat which is served out by the
War Office at the present day, and this is worn by
the Chapel Keeper at Wellington Barracks.</p>

<p>Of buttons we have already spoken times out of
number, and it may be interesting to mention here
that the various regiments of the Brigade of Guards
may be told by the arrangement of buttons on the
tunic. They are arranged at even distances apart in
the Grenadiers, in twos on the Coldstreams, and in
threes on the Scots Guards, and in fours on the Irish
Guards, which were created of recent years.</p>

<p>We find plenty of survivals in the Army of buttons
which are seen in similar places to those on civilians&rsquo;
clothes. Mr. P.&nbsp;W. Reynolds has pointed out
another, which is found in connection with a cord
loop on the collars of the officers of the Oxfordshire
Light Infantry. This is a survival of a fashion once
universal in the British Infantry, though the loop
often consisted of half-inch lace instead of cord.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
The button was originally on a turned-down collar,
and previous to that was on the coat, coming through
a hole in the collar with a view to holding the latter
properly in place.</p>

<p>If officers and sergeants were seen together it
would probably be noticed that the former wear their
sashes over the left shoulder, whilst the latter wear
theirs over the right. To this a single exception can,
however, be found. In the Twenty-ninth Foot the
sergeants and officers both wear their sashes over
the left shoulder, and this custom has been traced
back to the battle of Culloden, where so many
officers were slain that the sergeants had to take their
places.</p>

<p>The drummers of the Leicestershire Regiment on
state occasions wear tiger-skin aprons instead of the
usual ones of pipeclayed leather. This is connected,
as is also their badge, with their services in India.</p>

<p>A point that is perhaps not generally known is that
officers going on voyages in hot climates are allowed
to substitute the kamarband for the mess waistcoat,
various colours being adopted by various regiments.</p>

<p>We have seen the origin of the red coat so far as it
affects the modern army. Under these circumstances
it is hardly necessary to say that it is not intended to
prevent the soldier from seeing his blood when he is
wounded, as has sometimes been suggested. It might
be taken as acting as a warning colour like that of
the wasp or hornet, but we have also noticed the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
in which conspicuous dress is replaced by protectively
coloured uniforms when the soldiers are upon active
service.</p>

<p>We cannot help mentioning, however, one case in
which the ornamental garb of peace proves useful to
its wearer. We find in the animal kingdom that,
whatever may happen in modern times in our own
case, the males are as a rule the more brightly
coloured, and we have come to call the brilliant hues
with which they are endowed &ldquo;courtship colours.&rdquo;
The charm which our gallant soldiers seem to have
for the fair sex surely entitles us to reckon the gay
uniforms of our Army as coming into the category
of &ldquo;courtship colours.&rdquo;</p>

NAVAL UNIFORMS</h2>

<p class="srt2">SUPPOSED SURVIVALS&mdash;PETTICOATS AND WIDE BREECHES</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">If</span> we had headed this chapter &ldquo;survivals in naval
dress,&rdquo; we should have been in the historic predicament
of the writer who took as his topic the
snakes of Iceland, and afterwards had to own that
there were none. It would be better, however, if
we were to say that there are no survivals of a strictly
naval kind, as then we should be nearer the truth.
There are, of course, in the uniform of both officers
and men, plenty of survivals from civilian costume,
such as we have spent much time in describing.
Though the crews of the galleys, which are the boats
reserved for the captain&rsquo;s use, had, in the case of the
smart ships, long been dressed in a uniform manner,
the actual uniforms of the Navy only date from a
little before the year 1767.</p>

<p>The colours, blue and white, so tradition says,
were due to an inspiration which George&nbsp;II received,
while the subject was under discussion, on seeing the
Duchess of Bedford riding in a new habit which was
of blue faced with white.</p>

<p>There are two points in the dress of the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
sailor which are commonly supposed to be interesting
survivals, and indeed they appear on the surface to
have all the makings of such. It has been thought
that the black silk handkerchief which a sailor wears
round his neck was first put on as mourning for the
death of Nelson. The other matter is the blue jean
collar which covers the similar-shaped one which is
made of the same material as the sailor&rsquo;s jumper.
This would no doubt have protected its fellow from
the grease of the pigtail which sailors wore once;
but Commander Robinson, who has gone into the
question, says that pigtails were discarded before
the blue jean collar came into existence, and at the
same time tells us that black silk handkerchiefs were
adopted previous to the time of Nelson. It is not
perhaps very widely known that sailors at one time
wore a kind of kilt or petticoat, and this no longer
ago than the year 1779.</p>

<p>Some thirty or forty years earlier there were in
vogue loose slops like the petticoat breeches of the
reign of Charles&nbsp;II, and the collar of the coat, which
was open at the neck, turned back on to the
shoulders.</p>

<p>The trousers, however, that are now adopted are
tight round the body and thighs, but remain very
loose round the legs, and are therefore somewhat
curious. The method of buttoning is one which they
share with the gentlemen of George&nbsp;II&rsquo;s time, the
old-fashioned labourer, and, we believe, the bishop.</p>

THE COSTUME OF PUPPETS</h2>

<p class="srt2">PUNCH AND JUDY&mdash;FASHION DOLLS&mdash;DOLLS IN SWADDLING
CLOTHES&mdash;THE EGYPTIAN &ldquo;SHABBIES&rdquo;</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">By</span> way of a change let us turn from people to
their images&mdash;in fact, to puppets and dolls&mdash;for
these semblances and caricatures of human forms are
generally clothed, and at times may present to us very
curious survivals. Let us begin with Punch and
Judy, and in this connection we must not forget the
dog Toby, for the ruff which he wears round his neck
is a reminiscence of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign. Punch
himself, however, is very much older than his clothes,
though to find the explanation of the hump in front
we must examine the clothes of the time of Henry&nbsp;III
of France, when the men&rsquo;s busked doublets came
down low to a strap-shaped point, and had a great
padded punch-like protuberance.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>For other peculiarities that we see we may have to
go to the times of Henry&nbsp;IV of France, but the character
is very many centuries older; and the careful
investigations made by a friend of the present writer,
Mr. George Heppel,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> into the history of Punch have
shown why his present costume was adopted and
what was his prototype.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>As might be expected, the original Punch was a
man&mdash;not Pontius Pilate, as has sometimes been
suggested owing to the connection of Punch with
miracle plays, but a character in the old Italian farces,
which go back to the early days of Rome. The town
most celebrated for such entertainments was Atella,
situated not very far from Naples. The farcical plays
were full of buffoonery, and Punch or Pulicinella was
one of the stock characters, represented by a live
actor, as were also the originals of the Harlequin,
Pantaloon, and Scaramouch, among others.</p>

<p>It appears that the plays were not written as we
understand a play to be written, but as a rule the plot
of them was known, and a great deal of the dialogue
was left to the actors themselves. From this it will
be seen that the art of gagging can hardly be considered
to be modern. The Italian, though by no
means great as a dramatic author, was, as he is now,
exceedingly good as an actor. It is said<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> that for
genuine fun no dramatist can beat the Neapolitan, no
actor can surpass him. He writes or acts without the
least effort; it is born in him, and he cannot help it.
The very beggar-boy who hunts one along the street
is a consummate actor; his gestures are prolific, easy,
and natural; he is a facial artist without knowing it,
and he has a power of elocution and expression which
are only acquired by experienced performers after
many years of study.</p>

<p>It may perhaps come as a surprise to many, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
how long Punch has persisted, to learn that in Italy
he was not one of the important characters in the
original plays, but his choice as the hero of the
puppet-show depended rather on the fact that he had
not so much to do as some of the others&mdash;the harlequin,
for instance. Therefore his character could be
better portrayed under the restricted conditions that
prevailed in such an entertainment as the Punch and
Judy show. It will be obvious also that only two
characters can be acting at one time, as the showman
has only two hands. Mr. Heppel could only trace
one instance of Punch figures being worked by wires
like other marionettes. This is a figure in a little
book no larger than a playing-card, entitled &ldquo;ScÃ¨nes
de Polichinelle,&rdquo; in the Art Library at the South
Kensington Museum.</p>

<p>The showman in the case of the French Punch on
occasion makes a virtue of necessity, and when the
hero of the puppet-show is about to be tried for
murder, the performance is interrupted in order that
the following apology may be made:&mdash;&ldquo;The scene
which we are about to have the honour to put before
you requires a tolerably large number of characters.
It is, indeed, impossible to suppose that so important
a prisoner as Guignol should be tried without due
ceremony and by a single judge, but as the director
of this theatre, like the generality of mankind, has but
two hands, the actors in this scene will most of them
remain quite still. This need not in the least interfere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
with the truth of the representation, for this stillness
gives the administration of justice an additional
solemnity. We may suppose that the judges are
asleep, which will enable them to decide free from
passion, and that the officials of the court are paralysed
by the majesty of the court and the magnitude
of the issues to be determined.&rdquo;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The Punch and Judy show went on in Italy side by
side with the farces that were represented by living
actors, but the idea of puppet-shows is very much
more ancient than this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The clothes of Punch were plain, and illustrations
made in 1630 are similar to others made a hundred
years later (see Figures <a href="#fig149">149</a> and <a href="#fig150">150</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<p>Originally, also, Punch does not seem to have had
a long nose. The exaggerated nose is, however, found
on the representative of Punch which flourished in
Calabria, and which went by the name of &ldquo;Giangurgolo&rdquo;
(see Figure <a href="#fig150">150</a>).</p>

<p>The French Punch is called Guignol, of which the
derivation cannot be directly traced, but Mr. Heppel
has made an interesting suggestion that in the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of this character is to be found that of Giangurgolo
in a contracted form.</p>

<p>As may have been surmised, we got our Punch and
Judy by way of France, but as a human actor Punch
himself came direct to England.</p>

<p>An ancient statuette which is figured by Ficorroni
(see Figure <a href="#fig151">151</a>) is supposed by antiquarians to represent
Punch, and if the individual whom it represents
did not go by that name, he must certainly have been
one of Punch&rsquo;s ancestors, for the likeness to our
modern hero is exceedingly great. References are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
made by a number of classical authors to puppet-shows,
and these were also known in China as long
ago as a thousand years before the Christian era.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The method also of exhibiting the puppets is
not very modern, for a very interesting figure of
a show embellishes the celebrated MS. of the
&ldquo;Roman d&rsquo;Alexandre&rdquo; (see Figure <a href="#fig152">152</a>) which is
preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and
was executed between the years 1338 and 1344.
The figures were evidently worked by the hands as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
in Punch and Judy, and that it was intended to
amuse children is shown by three little girls who
are represented as looking on.</p>

<p>Though sticks are not strictly a part of dress, unless
we consider the canes of the dandies as being so,
yet their usefulness in puppet-shows is so great that
we are tempted to digress for a moment to give the comments
of M. Lemercier de Neuville on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stick! that is the great argument of Guignol,
as well as of Polichinelle. The stick settles everything.
It puts an end to disputes, it pays debts, it
sends away troublesome people, it disciplines wives, it
takes vengeance on men, it is the &lsquo;Deus ex machina&rsquo;
of all this Lilliputian world. What a marvellous
dramatic resource it is. If a situation becomes difficult
to manage, settle it with a blow of the stick. If a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dÃ©nouement</i> seems to hang fire, hasten its progress
by a thrashing. The stick is above all criticism; it
checkmates it, it destroys it, for it is in the right, in
spite of everybody, because it is the strongest. The
stick has no respect of persons. With it Guignol
beats his creditors, his friends, his wife, the constable,
the judge, the hangman, and the more he strikes the
more he makes people laugh. There is no spoken
joke that is as good as this. And yet the stick is not
beautiful, nor is it new. One sees that it has done
duty for a long time, for it is worn out and cracked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have, in fact, a record of Italian players coming
to act their farces in this country in 1577, but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Punch in the capacity of a person is now obsolete
with us, we shall only incidentally refer to him as a
living actor, though perhaps we might recall the fact
that MoliÃ¨re introduced him into his play <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Malade
Imaginaire</cite>.</p>

<p>We have spoken already of Punch&rsquo;s hump in
front, and it may be interesting in this connection to
give the opinion of a Frenchman on the subject of
Punch&rsquo;s bodily characteristics. M. Magnin says that
with a sufficient amount of exaggeration and caricature
to set aside the suspicion of disloyalty, the Punch
figure recalls the appearance of some Gascon officer
imitating the walk and demeanour of Henri&nbsp;IV in
the Guard Chamber of St. Germain or in the Louvre.
The hump in front, he says, was derived from the
protuberance of the heavy cuirass. This is much the
same explanation as that which we have already
given, though the cuirass probably stuck out in front
of its wearer even more than did the doublet.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that the French like gayer
dresses than the Italians, and we have seen that even
in 1630 the clothes of Harlequin, Pantaloon, and
Scaramouch in Italy were, like those of Punch, plain
and simple; but in order to be popular in France the
Pulicinella had to dress in a new style, and it is known
that already in 1649 the puppet-show of which he is
the hero had set up on the left bank of the Seine,
opposite the Louvre. When Punch got to England
it was at a time when gay clothes were worn, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
some relics of these he has retained to the present
day.</p>

<p>Red and yellow play a considerable part in the
dress of the Punch figures used by Mr. W.&nbsp;H. Jesson,
the members of whose family have for generations
been performers of Punch and Judy, and who is one
of the few that are still left. Punch has a very high
cap of antique appearance, with turned-up brim and a
bow of ribbon on the top. The hump on his back is
almost horn-like, and forms a complete circle. It
seems unlikely that this appendage was developed
from any part of costume unless it were perhaps the
liripipe; but we may rather imagine that in the past
Pulicinella may have been represented as being a
hunchback, and certainly Figure <a href="#fig151">151</a>, taken from the
statuette mentioned previously, suggests an individual
suffering from such a deformity.</p>

<p>Punch also wears a ruff (see Figure <a href="#fig153">153</a>), though it
is not a separate part of his costume, as in Judy&rsquo;s
case, where it is of lace and its character is well
shown, as it consists of more than one thickness.
Judy&rsquo;s head-dress is the mob cap which was fashionable
in the time of George&nbsp;III. (See Figure <a href="#fig154">154</a>.)</p>

<p>The beadle, with his three-cornered hat and his
brightly trimmed coat and cape, has survived for a
century or so after his clothes first became fashionable,
and no doubt in the puppet-show he will persist
for many years when every living representative of his
kind has passed away. (See Figure <a href="#fig155">155</a>.) Of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
more characters we have a word to say,&mdash;in the first
place, of the doctor, who is brought before us in
clothes of almost clerical cut, which remind us of the
fact that the members of the medical profession were
once more easily recognized by their dress than they
are now (see Figure <a href="#fig156">156</a>); in the second, of Toby,
whose sole costume consists of a ruff, that once more
takes us back to the time of Good Queen Bess.</p>

<p>Though Punch has donned new clothes and altered
his habits to suit not only the countries in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
sojourned, but the times in which he has performed,
yet despite these and other changes that have gone
on since he set foot on these islands, there is one
thing that has always been his special characteristic.
This is his squeaky voice, which he retained even in
MoliÃ¨re&rsquo;s play, and it is from the peculiarity of his
voice that he gained his name. Pulicinella means a
&ldquo;hen-chicken,&rdquo; which might well be expected to
have a squeaky voice.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>With regard to the changes in Punch&rsquo;s behaviour we
have a word to say. Originally he was somewhat of
a composite character, the constituent elements being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
derived from several of the personages of the larger
theatre. At first, to the amorous and intriguing ways
of Pulicinella there was added the roguery of Scaramouch,
as well as the dash and braggadocio of the
Spanish captain who was a member of the comedy
company, akin to the Miles Gloriosus of Plautus and
the Bobadil of Ben Jonson.</p>

<p>As time went on there was less love-making and
trickery and more knocking about, but Mr. Heppel
will not allow that the French writers are right in
ascribing the whole of this to English influence. For
the fact that the puppets are not alive gives an opportunity
for dealing blows with a reality that could not
be tolerated if the actors were living, and when we
remember the way in which dog Toby seizes Punch
by the nose, we cannot help feeling that the effect could
hardly be so realistically produced on the actual stage.</p>

<p>In France, Punch is a bachelor, or if he is married
he is not very much married, while in England Punch
always runs in double harness. Another alteration
has taken place. Polly, who was one of the characters
that have disappeared, has departed for the
reasons put into the showman&rsquo;s mouth by Mr. Henry
Mayhew in 1861. &ldquo;Miss Polly was left out, because
it wasn&rsquo;t exactly moral. Opinions has changed. We
ain&rsquo;t better, I fancy. Such things goes on, but people
don&rsquo;t like to let it be seen now; that&rsquo;s the difference.
Judy&rsquo;s dress, you see, is far different, bless you, than
Miss Polly&rsquo;s. Judy&rsquo;s, you see, is bed-furniture stuff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and Polly&rsquo;s is all silk and satin. Yes, that&rsquo;s the way
of the world; the wife comes off second best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As in old times, there was much buffoonery introduced
even into religious plays, and the characters
which have been separated from the other performers
to take part in the special harlequinade of the modern
pantomime used, together with Punch, to appear side
by side with those who took the part of religious
personages. To uneducated people there seemed
nothing profane about this; but as time went on men
and women came to look at matters in a different light.
For reasons somewhat similar, the devil and the ghost
are now left out, and in the performances that are given
in drawing-rooms even the coffin, in some cases.</p>

<p>The connection, however, of Punch with religious
plays probably accounts for the name by which his
wife now goes. Those who mistakenly supposed
that the word Punch was derived from Pontius Pilate
looked upon Judy as representing Judas Iscariot.
We have already pointed out the origin of the
former appellation, which ante-dates the Christian
era, while a difficulty is met with in the fact that the
wife of Punch for many years was known as Joan.
Mr. Heppel says that of the miracle plays some of
the most popular were taken from the Apocrypha,
and a very favourite subject was the tale of Judith
and Holofernes. If we cannot find an instance
recorded of Punch furnishing the amusement in this
story, we can, at any rate, find an advertisement of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
play in which Harlequin and Judith were together,
and the comic business was sometimes entrusted to
Punch and sometimes to Harlequin. Hence Punch
and Judy may not improbably have come from
Punch and Judith, while Toby naturally suggests the
dog in the book of Tobit.</p>

<p>With regard to Toby, it may be said that he is represented
in France by a cat, and that until the nineteenth
century he was only a stuffed figure. In
China, where Punch beats his wife to the music of
the clarionette instead of PandÃ¦an pipes held in a
muffler, Toby is replaced by a wooden dragon with
jaws that snap, and this figure is also now introduced
in England. Hector the horse has quite disappeared.
We might mention here that in the
English version a clown is brought in with very considerable
effect.</p>

<p>There is another connection of dolls with costume
rather than of costume with dolls which we may
mention at this point. In the fourteenth century,
when there were no fashion plates, and written descriptions
would hardly do their duty effectively,
model costumes were put upon dolls and sent from
country to country. It is, moreover, a curious and
interesting fact that it was principally from Paris
that these fashions were sent out.</p>

<p>Examples of national costumes sometimes survive
on the bodies of dolls. The figure of St. Nicholas,
in Belgium, shows an old dress, and the costume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
dolls of Holland, France, and Switzerland are excellent
records of native dress now seldom seen in
everyday life. Mr. Edward Lovett bought a little
doll in Lucerne which is in a cradle, and shows excellently
well the swaddling clothes that were formerly
in use. Ancient Greek and Roman dolls, taken from
children&rsquo;s graves, were similarly dressed, and a modern
Russian doll, which is also in possession of Mr. Lovett,
is shown with the swathing band <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i>. The only
dolls that are to be found in Malta represent ancient
saints, and it is said that they are dressed as such.</p>

<p>The long garments of Noah and his sons in the
toy Noah&rsquo;s Ark are worthy of mention and are an
interesting survival.</p>

<p>The wrappings that were placed round mummies
in ancient Egypt are shown on figures which were
found in the tombs, and which are often seen as
curiosities in this country. They were carved out
of wood or modelled out of clay, while some of them
were made out of the well-known glazed faÃ¯ence.
They were put into the tombs in order that they
might do the work of the deceased in his after life,
and their origin is exceedingly interesting. Many
barbarous nations have in the past sacrificed the
servants of a chief at his funeral, and the Egyptians,
who were humane people, contented themselves with
a make-believe, and replaced the actual persons with
the figures that we call &ldquo;ushabti,&rdquo; or, in modern
parlance, &ldquo;shabbies.&rdquo;</p>

THE CLOWN AND PAINTING THE BODY</h2>

<p class="srt1">THE CLOWN&rsquo;S DRESS&mdash;SAVAGE PAINTING AND SURVIVALS
OF IT&mdash;TATTOOING&mdash;PATCHES AND FALSE COMPLEXIONS&mdash;MASKS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">No</span> costume is perhaps more characteristic or
better known than that of the clown; and it is
of special interest, for while the hat was fashionable at
the beginning of the fifteenth century, the dress, generally
speaking, is a caricature of that which was in
vogue in the time of Queen Elizabeth. The same
remarks apply to the method of hair-dressing, and we
shall see, when dealing with the other characters that
appear in the harlequinade, that the pantaloon in his
dress illustrates that of the same time in our history.</p>

<p>Unlike the other heroes of the pantomime, the
clown is essentially English, and he is to be found
also in the circus of to-day, at all times of the year,
as well as on the stage at Christmas.</p>

<p>As to the clown&rsquo;s clothes, first of all there is the
ruff, which is, however, not stiffened out. He has
trunk hose or wide breeches which do not reach to
his knee, his stockings are well ornamented with
clocks; and lastly, there is the paint on his face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
which brings us to a custom that seems nearly as old
as man himself. (See Figure <a href="#fig157">157</a> and Plate <a href="#plate10">X</a>,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>The Egyptians still follow the practice of blackening
the edge of the eyelid, both below and above the
eye, with a black powder called kohl. The material is
prepared either from burning an aromatic resin or the
shells of almonds. The custom prevailed among both
sexes in Egypt far back in its history, and long before
the historic period, painting the eyes was already practised
by the people whom Professor Petrie called the
&ldquo;New Race&rdquo; (until he determined that they preceded
the dynastic Egyptians).</p>

<p>It may be well to point out that these prehistoric
people lived about 6000 years <span class="f8">B.C.</span>: they had little or
no metal, though they made most beautiful flint knives
and stone vases. They buried their dead lying on
one side with the knees towards the chin, instead of
making mummies. Among the contents of their tombs
have been found curious slate palettes of all shapes
and sizes, similar to some which had previously been
known for many years, but the origin of which was
undetermined. It has been shown that these palettes
were used for grinding up malachite to form a green
colour with which to paint the eye. The idea was, it
is supposed, to mitigate the glare of the sun, and is
similar to that which leads Anglo-Indians to have the
under sides of the brims of their hats coloured green.</p>

<p>Another kind of temporary ornamentation is produced
in Egypt to-day by staining the feet and hands
with the juice of the leaves of henna. The result is that
the part to which it is applied becomes a yellowish
red or deep orange colour. The most common practice
is to dye the tips of the fingers and toes so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the first joint, the whole of the inside of the hand and
the sole of the foot, and there are other and more
fanciful modes of applying the henna, which is said to
have an agreeable effect upon the skin, particularly in
the way of preventing it from becoming too tender.
The dyeing has to be renewed every fortnight or three
weeks, and the stain is brighter and more permanent
on the nails than on the fingers.</p>

<p>Among many native races in a low stage of civilization
there are few who do not decorate their body by
painting it in some way. We have already mentioned
that painting takes away the appearance of nakedness,
and that many nations would be as much ashamed
to be seen without their paint, as Europeans would be
to walk about without their clothes. On special occasions,
however, particularly striking colours are put
on&mdash;for instance, by the Australians when about to
dance a corroboree, and Professor Moseley<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> has
pointed out that they have breast stripes and leg
stripes such as those which are seen on European
uniforms. At first sight these, as Professor Moseley,
indeed, points out, would appear to have quite a different
origin, but it will be remembered that when
speaking of the Hussar uniform and the Dutch skeleton
dress (see pages <a href="#Page_145">145</a>-<a href="#Page_146">6</a>) it was suggested that the ornamentation
might be intended to follow the lines of the
chief bones of the body, and it is possible that the
same idea may have underlain the painting carried
out by savages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>In this case what in one instance was effected by
paint was in the other done by means of trimmings.</p>

<p>Paint plays a great part in savage warfare, and
no doubt the intention very often was to terrify
the adversary. It is apparently this idea which
actuated the old inhabitants of this country, who, as
CÃ¦sar says, stained themselves with woad in order to
be of horrider aspect in battle; but Dr. Tylor has
pointed out the error into which many historians have
fallen through considering as savages races who,
while having attained to considerable civilization, still
kept up the practice of colouring their bodies in
time of war. To the instances which we have mentioned
of modern races staining themselves, we may
add that of the Hindu women in India, who colour
their teeth black and paint their feet scarlet. Japanese
women blacken their teeth upon marriage.</p>

<p>In certain Japanese plays the actors have bright
streaks of red paint made on their faces, usually on
each side of the eyes (see Plate <a href="#plate10">X</a>, Figure <span class="f8"><a href="#plate10b">B</a></span>).</p>

<p>Professor Moseley<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> records that the same form
of painting is to be seen in the case of Japanese children
on festive occasions, for after they have been
elaborately dressed by their parents they are further
adorned with one or two transverse and narrow streaks
of bright red paint, leading outwards from the outer
corners of their eyes, or placed near to that position.
The style is the same as that which survives
in the case of adults on the stage. Professor Moseley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
brings forward a further case showing that such a
form of painting possibly existed in ancient times in
China. When a man of distinction died in China in
former times, a certain number of servants were sacrificed
at his burial. Now, figures made of pasteboard
and paper, about three feet or so high, are burnt
instead at the funeral service in small furnaces provided
for the purpose in the temples, together with
cartloads of similar pasteboard gifts which are sent
by the survivors for the use of the dead in the next
world. Earthenware figures were similarly buried
with great men in old times in Japan, and we may
compare with these customs that of the Egyptians
who buried models of servants, as mentioned on page
268, in the graves of their dead.</p>

<p>The pasteboard heads of these funeral servants and
retainers are painted with streaks, some of which are
put on in almost exactly the same style, at the angles
of the eyes, as those of modern Japanese actors. It
seems a fair conjecture that the streaks on these heads
are a direct survival of an actual former savage form
of painting which was once in vogue in China, and
probably used to make fighting men hideous.</p>

<p>It is well known that primitive customs survive in
connection with funerals all over the world with
extreme tenacity. The numerous interesting survivals
existing in the case of English funerals are
familiar.</p>

<p>We give a figure taken from the head of a Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
servant, which Professor Moseley bought at a manufactory
of funeral properties in Hong Kong. (See
Plate <a href="#plate10">X</a>, Figure <span class="f8"><a href="#plate10c">C</a></span>.)</p>

<p>With regard to the ordinary use of paint by women
in China and Japan, Professor Moseley points out
that it is entirely different in principle from that in
vogue in Europe. He says: &ldquo;The use of paint as an
ornament in China and Japan seems to me to be of
considerable interest. In both countries the women
regularly paint their faces when in full dress, of which
the paint is a necessary part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The paint is not put on with any idea of simulating
a beauty of complexion, which might be present
naturally, or which has been lost by age. The
painted face is utterly unlike the appearance of any
natural beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An even layer of white is put on over the whole
face and neck, with the exception, in Japan, of two or
three angular points of natural brown skin, which are
left bare at the back of the neck as a contrast. After
the face is whitened, a dab of red is rubbed in on the
cheeks, below each eye. The lips are then coloured
pink with magenta, and in Japan this colour is put on
so thickly that it ceases to appear red, but takes on
the iridescent metallic green tint of the crystallized
aniline colour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In modern Japanese picture books, the lips of girls
may sometimes be seen to be represented thus green.
I suppose the idea is that such application of paint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
shows a meritorious disregard for expense. It is
curious that the use of aniline colour should have
so rapidly spread in China and Japan. In China, at
least, such was not to be expected; but it seems to
have supplanted the old rouge, and it is sold spread
on folding cards, with Chinese characters on them, at
Canton and in Japan. This form of painting the face
seems to be exactly of the same nature as savage
painting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The likeness of this painting to that of our clowns
is of course quite obvious.</p>

<p>Sometimes the painting of the body has a practical
advantage. The Andaman Islanders plaster themselves
with a mixture of lard and coloured earth,
which protects their skin from the heat and mosquitoes;
but, as Dr. Tylor points out, they go off into
love of display when they proceed to draw lines on
the paint with their fingers, or when a dandy will
colour one side of his face red and the other olive-green,
and make an ornamental border-line where the
two colours meet down his chest and abdomen.</p>

<p>Fashions in paint were quite as slavishly followed
as any other, and, as we see, have died hard. It is not
a very far cry from painting to tattooing. Of savages,
ThÃ©ophile Gautier has said that, having no clothes to
embroider, they embroider themselves. Scar tattooing
is connected with various rites such as are followed
when a brave arrives at manhood, and certainly
tattooing serves to indicate the family or tribe to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
which the ornamented person belongs. There is no
doubt, however, that the intention of much tattooing
is to increase individual beauty. Excellent examples
of this are to be found in the case of the Maoris,
whose faces were most elaborately covered with
designs. We are kindly permitted to reproduce
some of the drawings which General Robley has
made from specimens in his magnificent collection
(see Plate <a href="#plate10">X</a>, Figure <span class="f8"><a href="#plate10d">D</a></span>). The practice now, however,
is dying out. Of the Formosans it is said that their
skins are covered with flower patterns until they look
like damask.</p>

<p>Tattooing was practised by the old inhabitants of
this country, by the Jews and the earliest Egyptians:
it is still carried on in modern Egypt, chiefly on the
chin, on the back of the hands, the arms and feet, the
middle of the bosom, and the forehead. It survives
principally in the case of the women of the lower
classes and in the country. Among European sailors
and among the lower classes, and even occasionally
those up in high social scale, we find tattooing carried
on, though the original idea of ornamentation is lost
when the decoration is covered by clothing.</p>

<p>We have seen occasionally at shows&mdash;such as that
organized by Barnum&mdash;white people who have been
tattooed to a very great extent, and even in the case
of Europeans the patterns tend to take off the bare
look even of the white skin. No doubt the desire to
make permanent such ornamentation as that obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
by painting, led to the introduction of tattooing, and
just as some marks suggest that they are copied from
amulets, so some amulets show traces of having been
derived from tattoo patterns. Mr. Lovett has pointed
out to us that possibly the floral designs worked on
the backs of the bodices of the women of Marken, in
Holland, may have originated from tattooing, but no
doubt careful research would show some other and
undoubted instances.</p>

<p>The painting of the face, which is intended to
heighten its beauty and hide the ravages of time, is
quite another matter. It survives to the present day,
but luckily it is much less common in this country
than it was a few years ago. It does not, however,
seem to have been at all in vogue in England until
the Middle Ages, though cosmetics and false complexions
were made use of by ladies in Roman times.</p>

<p>Fairholt<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> quotes from an old French poem of
the thirteenth century which describes the wares of a
mercer who declares, &ldquo;I have cotton with which they
rouge, and whitening with which they whiten themselves.&rdquo;
The cotton took the place of the hare&rsquo;s foot
that is now used in making up, to rub colour on the
cheeks.</p>

<p>At this point we might consider patches, the use of
which made it possible to ornament the skin with
patterns that could be removed at will. These patches
came into fashion in Charles&nbsp;I&rsquo;s reign, but were banned
by the Puritans. As soon, however, as Charles&nbsp;II<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
came into his own again, they made their appearance
once more, and took various fantastic shapes: owls,
rings, crescents, and crowns; a coach and horses was
particularly fashionable, and in the time of Queen
Anne it was possible to tell the political views of
fashionable ladies by their faces and their fans. Party
feeling ran very high at this time, and those who were
neutral wore patches on both cheeks, a Whig lady on
the right side only, while a High Church Tory dame
only adorned the left, and she wore suspended from
her wrist a fan on which was depicted a scene from
the trial of Dr. Sacheverell at Westminster Hall.</p>

<p>Red and white paint was at the same time universally
employed by women of fashion, who, as Miss
Helen Gordon<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> says, had perforce to keep their lovers
at a respectful distance, lest a kiss &ldquo;snatched by a forward
one might transfer the complexion of the mistress
to the admirer.&rdquo; The untimely decease of more than
one famous beauty was attributed to the paint with
which she besmeared her countenance, a notable
instance being the death of Lady Coventry, whose
husband had been wont to chase her round the dinner-table
in his determined efforts to remove the deleterious
compound from her face with his serviette. According
to Walpole, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu used
the cheapest white paint obtainable, and left it so long
on her skin that it had literally to be scraped off. It
may be inferred that these fine ladies rarely washed;
but &ldquo;the age was careless in that respect, personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
cleanliness at a discount, and the essence pot consequently
in great demand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We spoke just now of fans, which can, perhaps, be
considered an article of dress as they are very often
fastened to the person. There seems no doubt but
that at first fans did not close, and were made of
feathers like those still in use in the East from whence
they are derived. Probably in the beginning, leaves
were used as fans, and palm-leaf fans are still to be
seen. Fans were in general use in the sixteenth
century, and the folding one appeared in the next.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as at the end of the eighteenth century,
large green fans, called sunshades, were used out of
doors in the same way as a modern parasol now is.
There is another use of the fan still to be noted in
China, namely, for blowing up a fire, and from this we
no doubt get the expression of &ldquo;fanning the flame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Painting apparently was not only practised by women,
for male courtiers at the end of the sixteenth century
occasionally coloured their faces. If we are to believe
some of the writers in the newspapers of to-day, men
of leisure are not a whit better nor less foolish now.</p>

<p>Of masks as an ordinary everyday addition to costume
we have no survivals, except in connection with
some balls and an occasional burglary; but masks
such as we see on the 5th of November will remind
us, like the face of the clown, of primitive face-painting,
and also of the many curious head-dresses and
masks which savages wear at certain ceremonies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
dances. It is easy to produce grotesque effects by
means of masks, and the discomfort that would arise
from the paint is thereby avoided.</p>

<p>The practice of wearing masks, and indeed dominoes,
by private individuals came from Venice. In
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries masks made
of black satin and velvet often formed part of the
toilet of society ladies. At one period the wearing of
them was restricted to the times of carnivals; at
another, the nobility alone were allowed to use them,
and now we only see masks at fancy-dress balls. Of
the unwritten laws that rule the wearing of the mask,
Mrs. Aria says<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>: &ldquo;Whether worn privately or in
public, its disguise has at all times and in all countries
been respected as inviolably sacred. To the
masked the greatest extravagance of language and
gesture is permitted. He is allowed to indulge in
acrid personalities and proclaim scathing truths,
which, even if addressed to the monarch himself, go
unrebuked. To strike a mask is a serious offence,
while in no class of society, however degraded, would
any one dare to unmask a woman. Yet another prerogative
entitles the masked to invite any woman
present, whether masked or not, to dance with him,
etiquette decreeing that the queen of the land may
not claim exemption from this rule. Dear to romance
is the masked highwayman, who flourished until the
advent of railways robbed him of his occupation; and
a grim figure is ever the masked headsman.&rdquo;</p>

STAGE COSTUMES</h2>

<p class="srt2">THE HARLEQUIN, PANTALOON, COLUMBINE, AND ACROBAT</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">While</span> Punch has left the stage and is now a
puppet, some of his coadjutors are with us,
for the harlequinade is still introduced into many
pantomimes at Christmas, and special plays have been
written in which these characters appear. The harlequin,
who gives his name to what is now an interlude,
was some thousand or two years back one of the
important personages in the old Italian comedy which
gave us Punch, and which we have already mentioned
in a previous chapter.</p>

<p>Harlequin was versatile and many-sided, and he
still keeps up his slap-dash character. It is true that
harlequin does not now speak, any more than does
the columbine, and we may trace the evolution of the
Italian Mimi, or buffoons, into the Pantomimi, who
were tragic actors. They, by means of certain well-understood
signs and gestures, were able to play
tragedies in the open air under conditions which
would have prevented their voices from being heard.
In some theatres also the actors were not allowed by
the authorities to speak. Originally the harlequin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
was a mime. He had a shaven head, a sooty face&mdash;for
the mimi blackened their faces like our modern
niggers&mdash;he had flat, unshod feet and a patched coat
of many colours which he derived from the ancient
peasants of Italy.</p>

<p>Some have seen in the wand of the harlequin a descendant
of the rod of Mercury, and have sought for
a prototype of the modern pantomime in pagan mysteries.
In England, however, we have turned the
harlequin into a magician, and his wand is perhaps
the gilt wooden sword which belonged to the clown
or fool all the world over. Now also we have the
character in what Mr. Calthrop terms his tight-fitting
lizard-skin of flashing golden colours, for the patches
on his rags have now given place to a symmetrical
pattern (see Figure <a href="#fig158">158</a>).</p>

<p>There have been many celebrated harlequins who
have devoted their lives to the development of this
character, and there is an interesting case which
Disraeli<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> gives in his &ldquo;Curiosities of Literature,&rdquo;
in which, as part of a quit-rent or feudal tenure&mdash;whenever
the Abbot of FigÃ©ac entered this town&mdash;the
Lord of Montbron, dressed in a harlequin&rsquo;s coat,
with one of his legs bare, has to lead the prelate&rsquo;s
horse by its bridle to the abbey.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 158.</span>&mdash;The dress of a modern harlequin.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the clown and the pantaloon we still have the
dress of Elizabethan times (see Figures <a href="#fig157">157</a> and <a href="#fig159">159</a>).
The paint on the former, as we have seen, will carry
us back to times of remote antiquity. His hat is of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
shape well known in early English history, and he himself
is English all through. The pantaloon, again, is
Italian. Both he and his Venetian breeches get their
names from St. Pantaleone, one of the patron saints of
Venice. Pantaleone was by no means an uncommon
patronymic in that place. In order to reconcile the
statements that the dress of the pantaloon is Elizabethan
and his nether garments are Venetian, which
might appear to be mutually contradictory, it must be
pointed out that the Venetian breeches had been introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
in the days of earlier Tudors, and were still in
vogue when Elizabeth was on the throne. The pantaloon&rsquo;s
red and green colours and his red heels are
also, as we have indicated, Elizabethan.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 159.</span>&mdash;A pantaloon, showing an Elizabethan costume of which
Venetian breeches form part.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The columbine, who, like the harlequin, does not
speak, and so keeps up the pantomime character,
wears the ballet dress of early Victorian times. Originally
she was a female harlequin, or harlequinne,
and her dress of spangles is still sometimes used in
fancy-dress dances. Of the other characters, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
once assisted those that we have described, we have
none left. Scaramouch persisted for some time, and
was, like the harlequin and columbine, a pantomimist.
He has gone even from Punch and Judy, though the
doctor still remains.</p>

<p>Though not strictly a theatrical performer, but seen
in the circus, the music-hall, and still also as a wandering
mountebank, we have the acrobat. His dress
is simple and eminently suitable for the work which he
has to do; it consists of a vest, of very short trunk hose
or breeches, and long Florentine hose, or, as we now
call them, tights. Though such a costume was worn
in the reigns of the early Tudors, in detail the breeches
are very much like those which were worn by Lord
Darnley, the husband of Mary Queen of Scots.
Doubtless also in the tights which are so familiar on
the stage we have a survival similar to that seen in
the acrobat, the clown, and the knights of the older
orders.</p>

NIGHTDRESS</h2>

<p class="srt2">BANDS ON NIGHTGOWNS&mdash;NIGHTCAPS&mdash;NIGHT ATTIRE
WORN IN THE STREET</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Going</span> to bed can hardly be called a ceremony;
but the dress in which the bulk of humanity
now sleeps can claim to be a special one. There are,
of course, many people, who are not mere casual
tramps, who sleep in their everyday clothes. Drovers
who have to go to out-of-the-way places with cattle,
where they can never be sure of getting a lodging,
will sleep possibly after merely removing their outer
coat, and it stands to reason that men engaged in this
business can hardly be bothered to carry luggage
with them. Any survivals that we may have to deal
with in the case of our airiest dresses will not take
us very far back into history, because our ancestors,
from all accounts, went to an extreme which is the
opposite to that which we have just been mentioning,
and instead of keeping on all their clothes at night,
they took them all off and put on no others. Mr.
Calthrop<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> graphically describes a scene which he supposes
to be taking place in the reign of William
Rufus. A lady is disturbed while getting ready for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
bed by a cry of &ldquo;sanctuary,&rdquo; and watches from her
window until the fugitive is let into the church by the
monks. In concluding his story, Mr. Calthrop says,
&ldquo;The night is cold. The lady pulls a curtain across
the window, and then, stripping herself of her
chemise, she gets into bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man&rsquo;s nightshirt is severe in cut like that which
he wears in the day, and the sides are slit up in both
garments as they are in the dalmatic and the tunics
worn by the Anglo-Saxons, which were like a day
shirt, longer behind than in front. A survival of the
latter as an outer garment is to be seen in the short
smocks worn by labourers who dig drains and do
similar work. The lady&rsquo;s nightgown may be elegantly
ornamented with lace in the same way as are the
linen garments which she wears in the daytime; but
very often we find a large collar edged with lace,
which recalls the falling band which we have had so
often to mention. (See Figure <a href="#fig160">160</a>.)</p>

<p>To a great extent sleeping suits of a coat and
trousers, which are known by the name of pyjamas,
have taken the place of the man&rsquo;s nightshirt. These
have the merit of making a man look more presentable
if called up on an emergency. We shall see, if
we contrast male and female fashions, that it has
always been customary for the costume of women to
follow that of men, though most ladies draw the line
at adopting trousers. We have heard, however, of
one young lady at least who does by night what she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
will not do by day, for she has given up her nightgown
in favour of pyjamas.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Here and there we find that nightcaps are still
worn. That belonging to an old lady, which we
figure (see Figure <a href="#fig161">161</a>), came from the village of
Bishopstone in Wiltshire, where no fewer than twelve
old ladies, all of them over eighty, still wear such a
head-dress at night. Nightcaps were worn by men
in the time of the Tudors, and that of Queen Elizabeth,
as is shown by the following extract from a bill
of 1547: &ldquo;Pd. for two nyght caps of vellvet for them,
8s. 0d.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>They were very elaborately embroidered at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
time, and in Mary&rsquo;s reign were mentioned in a sumptuary
law. Old men still wear nightcaps, and the
one we figure was used until lately at South Stoke in
Oxfordshire. It is of the familiar style that we associate
with such a head-dress, and has a tassel on the
top. (See Figure <a href="#fig162">162</a>.)</p>

<p>In the time of Queen Anne ladies wore their nightdresses,
or night-rails as they were called, in the
streets, and the fashion seems to have been in vogue
at later times, though every means were taken to try
and abolish it. It was not until a murderess was
persuaded to appear at her execution in a bedgown
that the fad was relinquished.</p>

THE DRESS OF ANIMALS</h2>

<p class="srt1">NATURAL REPRESENTATIVES OF CLOTHES&mdash;HORSE TRAPPINGS&mdash;AMULETS
ON HARNESS&mdash;DOGS&rsquo; DISGUISES&mdash;FASHIONS
IN THE FORM OF ANIMALS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Here</span> and there in the animal kingdom we find
that creatures protect themselves from injury
by building up cases and coverings from extraneous
materials, and these may very well be compared with
the armour and clothes of mankind. Protection may
be gained by merely securing something ready made
to take the place of a coat, as is done in the case of
the hermit-crab or &ldquo;soldier,&rdquo; which covers itself with
the shell of some dead mollusc. The caddis worm,
or larva of the caddis fly, builds its home of sticks
and stones or twigs, and thereby not only preserves
its soft body from injury, but also harmonizes with its
surroundings, in the same way as does the soldier on
active service in time of war.</p>

<p>To gain protection, also, some molluscs when
building their shells introduce stones and other
shells and corals into the edifice, so that they become
indistinguishable from the sea-bottom on which they
lie. Many caterpillars cover themselves with bits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
leaves, and even with the help of silk make spiral
shells that might easily be mistaken for those of
snails. The silk also, from which many of our gay
clothes are made, is spun by the silkworm, which,
like the larva of many moths, produces it in order to
protect the chrysalis while it rests.</p>

<p>We are occupied here, however, with the coverings
of animals that they owe to man, and first and foremost
of those creatures which have come in for his
polite attentions is the horse.</p>

<p>We may recall the armour by which the chargers of
the old knights were protected, and the trappings or
emblazoned coverings that were put over this in the
same way as the surcoat was made to cover the armour
of the knights. (See Figure <a href="#fig084">84</a>.) The trappings were
often made of coloured satin, and were embroidered
with gold and silver, and at the exhibition held by the
Burlington Fine Arts Society in 1905 a chasuble of
red velvet was shown, embroidered with the arms of
England in gold, which was apparently made from a
horse-trapper of the fourteenth century. Figure <a href="#fig084">84</a>
well shows how the horses carried the armorial bearings
of their masters.</p>

<p>In the ostrich-feather ornaments and the velvet
trappings of modern funeral horses, we still have
some remnants of the days of chivalry.</p>

<p>To-day horse clothing, though not intended to be
of an ornamental character, we should imagine, is still
often decorated with a monogram of the horse&rsquo;s owner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most interesting survivals in
connection with horses is to be found in the brasses
which decorate those used for carts and waggons.
Dr. Plowright<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> has shown that many of these ornaments,
which are really amulets put on to the harness
with a view to protecting the horses against the evil
eye, are of Moorish origin. He contrasts their style
with the ornamental details shown in the Alhambra,
and he figures a number which take the form of a
crescent, or a crescent enclosing an eight-rayed star,
and others in which the ornament shows eyes and eyebrows
conventionalized. In other cases we get the
fleur-de-lys treated in an arabesque way, the escallop
shell and the mystic interlaced triangles (which were
considered the talisman of talismans, and are known
as the seal of Solomon or the shield of David), with
a crescent in the centre. Miss Lina Eckenstein<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
figures many other horse brasses which can be compared
with those worn by Roman cart-horses. Among
them is the crescent, which was also worn by women
carved in ivory, and by certain senators as ornaments
on their shoes.</p>

<p>The crescent is made from a thin plate of metal,
and is worn by children on the west coast of India,
with the points upwards, as a protection against the
evil eye, and gold ornaments of similar shape are
among those which were worn in ancient Peru.</p>

<p>The moon, from times of remote antiquity, has
been represented by a ring for the full moon and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
half-ring or sickle for the crescent. Miss Eckenstein
does not, however, carry the origin of the horse
amulets back to the stone stage of civilization, but
she thinks that the crescent represents two boars&rsquo;
tusks joined together by a thong, and the horse-amulet
now worn in Italy shows the thinness and
sharpness of curve that would be evident in one
which was made out of boars&rsquo; tusks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;"><a id="fig163"></a>
<img src="images/fig163.png" width="167" height="203" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 163.</span>&mdash;An English horse amulet in the form of a crescent. The
flat places near the tips of the horns are evidence that the form is
derived from two boars&rsquo; tusks.</p>
</div></div>

<p>We may point out that in some English crescents
the hollows which one tusk makes by wearing against
its fellow are represented by little flat places on the
horns of the crescent near their tips. (See Figure
<a href="#fig163">163</a>.)</p>

<p>The brasses seen in England to-day are worn on
the face-plate, breast-plate, and martingale. On
grand occasions, such as May Day celebrations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the cart-horse parade of Whit Monday, brasses are
specially put on, though there is a tendency now for
them to be stamped out of thin metal instead of
being cast, with the result that they soon wear out.
German horses wear the crescent on a strap which
dangles below the right ear.</p>

<p>The English crescent from harness will be found
to match those which are represented on the horses
on Trajan&rsquo;s column and other monuments. The
same design is to be seen also on the harness of
camels and elephants. The most important symbol
besides the moon is that of the sun, which is worn on
the top of the head between the ears.</p>

<p>Heraldic brasses are not uncommon, and the heart-shaped
amulet is also seen; it is possible, too, that
this form may be connected with that of the flint
arrows, which we have already mentioned as being
worn as amulets. In Egypt, an amulet hung on a
cow is said to protect the woman who owns it, and
Miss Eckenstein suggests a similar origin in the case
of the heart worn by horses. A brass showing a horse
rampant, came from the estate of the Duke of Norfolk
at Arundel, and it will be seen on looking at
the arms of the nobleman in question that this device
forms one of the supporters of his shield.</p>

<p>In prehistoric Egypt the slate palettes on which
malachite was ground for face painting were often in
the form of two birds, with their bodies put back to
back, and their heads fully shown, and when this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
form degenerates it becomes a kind of heart-shaped
shield. Professor Petrie has pointed out that when
this decoration is used, as on coffins and elsewhere,
it is often thought to be merely a shield. Possibly
the heart-shaped amulet may have some connection
with this.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;"><a id="fig164"></a>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 164.</span>&mdash;An English horse amulet showing both the heart and the sun.</p>
</div></div>

<p>An amulet found by Professor Vellucci in Umbria
consisted of an arrow-head sewn upon a piece of
scarlet cloth, which was of a heart shape, and was
intended doubtless to emphasize the heart significance.
Another horse amulet, obtained by Miss Eckenstein
from Sicily, also consists of a piece of scarlet cloth cut
into the shape of a heart and decorated with tinsel.</p>

<p>An English horse brass seen in Figure <a href="#fig164">164</a> shows
both the heart and the sun.</p>

<p>While on the subject of horses, one might allude to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the wisps of straw which are twisted in the mane
and tail of cart-horses when they are for sale at
markets and fairs. Horses were sacrificed in the old
days; and as the slaying of domestic animals was
supposed to secure fruitfulness, the horse became
identified as a corn spirit, and the killing of horses
formed a necessary incident of the harvest. The
deity Demeter took upon himself the semblance
of a mare, and the word mare is applied in the Midlands
to the last uncut ears of corn, at which the
sickles are thrown in order to bring them down. It
is possible that the wisps of straw worn by horses
are connected with these ideas.</p>

<p>A very curious and interesting custom is represented
on the trappings of the horses ridden by the officers
of the 10th Hussars. These trappings are ornamented
on full-dress occasions with cowry shells; and to
find a parallel to this we have to go to the East, where
the head-stalls of the camels and mules are covered
with the shells, while round their necks and those
of donkeys there may hang an ornament or bell on a
band which is similarly decorated. It will be noted
that there is a pendant from the head of the Hussar
horse which resembles that of the mule of the Holy
Land. There is no doubt but that originally these
ornaments were really amulets, and it is said that
they are a survival of ancient phallic worship. (See
Figures <a href="#fig165">165</a>-<a href="#fig167">7</a>.)</p>

<p>Cowry shells were once generally used by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Hussars, and were revived in the case of the 10th
Hussars in connection with service in India.</p>

charger of the 10th Hussars. The pendant recalls that on
mules in Palestine.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Toby, as we have seen, is decorated with an
Elizabethan ruff, but the wearing of collars and bells
by pet animals is a remnant of a very old custom,
and on early mediÃ¦val brasses in this country, dogs
are often seen decorated with collars&mdash;sometimes
bearing their actual names&mdash;and with bells. Now
the wearing of a collar is enforced by law as a
means of identification. All dogs found without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
collars may be considered as strays, and the regulation
followed, as is well known, upon the muzzling
order by which hydrophobia was practically stamped
out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. C.&nbsp;J. Cornish<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> once considered the subject
of animals&rsquo; clothes, and made some interesting remarks
on horses&rsquo; hats and sun-bonnets. He described the
following sight, met with in Kensington Gore:
First came a costermonger with his horse duly
&ldquo;hatted&rdquo; and the hat trimmed with ribbon; next
came a lady wearing a hat, in a victoria. Her
horse also had a hat, and both hats had pink flowers
in them.</p>

<p>In Holland, cows wear rain-proof jackets all the
winter, and coats for show cattle are quite the fashion
in England. Mr. Cornish says that a really smart
Jersey cow would not like to be seen at a show
without her luggage&mdash;&ldquo;a chest containing, not only
her sleeping jacket, but her brushes and combs,
cosmetics and horn protectors. She puts on, or has
put on, a smarter jacket in the daytime if she has to
stand in a draughty place; if she is not sleeping out
it does not so much matter. There are many ladies
who would almost go without a jacket themselves
rather than see their best animals go to a show without
proper clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the North lambs are provided with waterproof
coats when going on to the hills. These garments
are called &ldquo;brats,&rdquo; and the name has been transferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
not only to the young sheep themselves, but
also to human babies. We are all familiar with the
clothes which monkeys wear when they go about
with organs, and the big apes which are exhibited
at shows are sometimes even clothed in the dress suit
of conventionality. Johanna, the chimpanzee which
was at Barnum&rsquo;s exhibition, looked very effective in
her petticoats, and the penguins at the Zoo, when
performing tricks, wear coats, while animal actors are
often dressed to suit their parts.</p>

<p>There is one case at least in which animals are
disguised by dressing them up. There was a duck-decoy
dog which was known to Mr. Cornish, which,
in the first instance, grew as much like a fox as it was
possible for a dog to be. This proved exceedingly
attractive to the ducks, which seem to have an irresistible
impulse to swim after a fox in order to see
what he is about. In a short time, however, they
get used to a particular dog, and their curiosity dies
away. Then the dog&rsquo;s master supplies him with a
disguise in the shape of a jacket made of sheepskin.
Furthermore, when this palls a rough woollen
jacket of a black colour is brought into requisition,
and the dog apparently knows the meaning of the
whole performance. In other cases the disguise of a
decoy dog takes the shape of a foxskin with its
brush.</p>

<p>Racing dogs, prize dogs, and pet dogs also have
their coats, and we have heard even of bracelets for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
poodles, while there are fashions which regulate the
way in which the hair of these dogs should be cut.
Just as men and women deform themselves, so they
mutilate their animals by the clipping of their ears
and the shortening of their tails&mdash;practices which are
worse than the dubbing of the birds&rsquo; combs in the old
days of cock-fighting, for the infliction of one slight
injury probably prevented many.</p>

<p>This deforming of animals is a savage custom, for
Hottentots twist the horns of their cattle and sheep,
while a number of horns are produced in Africa by
splitting the budding horns of the young animals.
Though not obviously causing any deformity, there
is one fashion which, though condemned by most
people, is still followed by otherwise cultured and
humane people. We refer to the bearing-rein with
which horses&rsquo; heads are kept in unnatural, uncomfortable,
and constrained positions.</p>

<p>If, however, we consider animal fashions as a whole,
and bring under discussion the colours and peculiarities
of the fur or feathers that cover their bodies, we shall
find that men from quite early times have amused
themselves with producing all manner of curious and
striking appearances. The fact is, that the ordinary
conditions and dangers of life in the open, which would
soon eliminate any creatures out of harmony with
their surroundings, do not act in the case of domesticated
animals very much; and this has been a help.
We have, therefore, white rats, piebald mice, gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
fishes&mdash;some even with several tails&mdash;yellow canaries,
frizzled bantams, hairless dogs, hornless cattle, booted
bantams, and top-knotted fowls, as well as hosts of
patterns and forms that are hardly to be numbered.
There is an adage that &ldquo;like produces like,&rdquo; but the
student of heredity has recently become aware of the
fact that animals of a certain colour may not always
produce offspring which resemble them in this
respect; but that in order to get the tint required
for show purposes, parents of some particular but
unfashionable colour should be chosen.</p>

<p>The colour of animals is taken into consideration
in connection with ceremonies. White elephants have
to be treated as if they were gods, and proverbially
cost much to keep. Black horses are usually used at
funerals; white or grey horses, which are much
decorated with the badges and insignia of the regiments,
carry the kettledrums of the cavalry. The
Scots Greys take their name from their horses, which
are all grey, like those with which, it is said, they
were supplied by William&nbsp;III in Flanders. Spotted
Dalmatian hounds are those which are chosen to run
by the side of carriages, while circus horses exhibit
much variety of colouring.</p>

<p>Whips are perhaps a little beside the subject,
though there are fashions with regard to them. Not
long ago it was customary for the whip stick in
connection with a smart turn-out to have a bend in
it. In various parts of the East the camel driver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
carries in a graceful manner a red forked stick, and
one of this form was used as a sceptre in ancient
Egypt from 5000 <span class="f8">B.C.</span> downwards, so that we meet
with a very interesting, if humble, survival of what
was once a royal ornament.</p>

COLOUR</h2>

<p class="srt1">IMPORTANCE OF COLOUR&mdash;INSTINCTIVE LOVE OF BRIGHT
HUES&mdash;DESIRABILITY OF COLOURED CLOTHES AND GAY
SCENES&mdash;COLOUR AND COMPLEXION</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> has been apparent throughout this book, as it is
in everyday life, that colour plays a tremendous
part. Not only has it often a great significance, but
its presence or absence must also have a considerable
effect upon the minds of the people at large. One
cannot help thinking that if women were to dress as a
whole in the same quiet, or let us say solemn, tints
which are characteristic of men in their everyday life,
how much we should lose. Yet that there is a craving
for bright colours is shown in every direction, and
that they are attractive to those who do not themselves
have an opportunity of wearing them is also
obvious. The High Church clergy in this country
make use of the coloured vestments that had developed
in the Roman Catholic Church previous to
the Reformation, and which have been proclaimed
illegal.</p>

<p>The new universities vie with the older seats of
learning in the colours which they choose for gowns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and hoods. It is merely a question of expense which
prevents the fancy-dress dance from being more common
than it is. The pageants which have been held in
various parts of this country, and the profits which
have been made in many cases, bear out what we
have said. Men, as shown by the red coats which
they don for hunting and golfing, the colours in which
they ride steeplechases or play hockey, or the dresses
in which they bathe, seek as far as possible during
their leisure hour pursuits to go back to bright array.</p>

<p>Plays also are popular which are cast in the times
when picturesque attire flourished or which borrow it
from Oriental countries. The significance of colour
is exceedingly far reaching. The ordinary liveries of
Royalty in this country are red; the red shirt of the
followers of Garibaldi, the red cap of Liberty in the
French Revolution, the red rose of Lancaster, call
to mind great struggles. The platelayer, it is said,
is instructed to wear a red tie so that on emergency it
may be used as a danger signal. A red ribbon
worn in the hair of a girl in some places on the
Continent shows that she is engaged to be married,
and it is with a red rag that the chulos in the bull
fight enrage the bull. The term &ldquo;born in the purple&rdquo;
alludes to this colour having been that adopted by emperors
and kings in the past. Yellow is a favourite
colour with gipsies; the women wear yellow kerchiefs
and yellow beads, while the men favour yellow neckties.
Mr. Yoxall<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> points out that this colour was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
worn by mediÃ¦val Jews, and had a contemptuous
or degrading significance. We have seen that yellow
has been chosen as a mourning colour in Oriental
countries, and possibly it was adopted on some particular
occasion by gipsies like the black worms that
we have mentioned in the lace of military uniforms,
and has never been entirely left off since.</p>

<p>Among savages, yellow comes next in popularity
to red, and it is said that young children are also fond
of red, but are inclined to prefer yellow. The latter
colour is not so stimulating as red, and this is well
shown by the fact that the red light used in
photographic works was found to cause so much
mental irritation on the part of the workers that
it has been abandoned in many cases in favour of
orange. As regards the preference of older persons,
it has been found that schoolgirls are more precocious
than boys in the discrimination of colours, and never
prefer orange to any other colour, yet they choose
yellow rather than green, and usually than violet,
but never prefer it to red or blue.</p>

<p>As age goes on, male students shift their liking
towards the violet end of the spectrum which is the
favourite one with men, while women keep to the red.
Blue is associated in this country with the boat race
held between representatives of the two old Universities
of Oxford and Cambridge, and blue is usually
taken to represent the Liberal side in political elections.
The blue blouse of the butcher is characteristic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
and, as we have found, is a still better instance
of the survival of a trade costume than that seen in
the case of servants. The colour, it is said, was
chosen, as blood stains are not so noticeable upon it
as upon other tints. A black habit is that which the
clergy adopt when not engaged in religious duties,
while white has for centuries been used by them
when conducting services. The same two colours, if
we can so call them, are to be found in mourning,
and to them a man is now restricted when he appears
in ordinary Court or evening dress. The use of
colour merely as a distinguishing mark without any
deeper origin or special significance is so general that
we shall touch upon it, and recall one or two instances
with which we have previously met.</p>

<p>The gorgeous dresses of the Masons and the bright
green scarfs of their humbler brethren, the Foresters,
are further evidences of the love which civilized man
still retains of dressing himself up. It is only but
little less strongly developed apparently in him than it
is in his children and in savage people.</p>

<p>We pointed out that red, although a special character
of the British Army, is very far from being the
universal colour of the uniform. We have had to
deal with blue, buff, white, and black among the
other colours that are to be seen adorning the bodies
of our soldiers. The colours of heraldry no longer
appear on our persons, except when we wear favours
such as ribbons of red, white, and blue that come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
from national flags, and here we may recall that the
standards of our regiments are called their &ldquo;colours,&rdquo;
and illustrate not only regimental but national history.
The part that colour plays in the hoods and
gowns of academical dress has on more than one
occasion occupied our attention. Various coloured
veils serve to differentiate the sisters of a religious
order, while the ribbons and mantles of the knightly
orders serve a similar purpose. It seems a great pity
that at the present day the chapters or meetings
of these Orders are seldom if ever held, and it would
surely be interesting and useful, as well as enlivening,
for certain occasions to be created on which the public
might have an opportunity of seeing more of the
dresses which have been handed down to our own
times.</p>

<p>It is true that the King has of recent years opened
Parliament in person, and glimpses may have been
had of him in his state robes by a privileged few, but
surely some opportunity should be found of having
more pageants which are real and where there is no
need for any make-believe. Besides having the
advantages which we have urged would accrue from
the bringing of a little more colour into our lives,
such meetings would also have a practical result, and
be exceedingly good for trade.</p>

<p>It is obvious that certain costumes, particularly the
gay peasant dresses of the Continent, suit the style,
complexion, and colouring of those who wear them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
In races like our own, where we have all kinds of
stages between the very fair blonde and the very dark
brunette, the question of the choice of colours from
an artistic point of view is important. There is also
the question of surroundings to be considered, though
nowadays it is not every one who can afford the time,
as the late Mrs. Haweis did, to visit the rooms in
which she was invited to spend an evening, so that
the colours of her costume might be arranged to
harmonize with her temporary surroundings.</p>

PATTERNS</h2>

<p class="srt2">ANCIENT DESIGNS&mdash;CHECKS AND TARTANS&mdash;PARTI-COLOURED
CLOTHES&mdash;EVOLUTION OF ORNAMENTATION</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> subject of patterns is a very wide one, and
we shall content ourselves with mentioning a
few to show how these have survived. When speaking
of studs, we had occasion to mention the swastika
or fylfot, which is probably the earliest known
symbol. It is the forerunner of the cross, and it
occurs on ecclesiastical vestments as well as civil
clothes, and the well-known key pattern was derived
from it. On Plate <a href="#plate07">VII</a>, Figure <span class="f8">F</span>, it may be seen on
the shoulder of the Romano-Egyptian man, and its
use seems to be almost universal. The pine pattern
which we see on shawls is of Eastern origin, and it is
said that it originally was taken from a map of some
rivers in Cashmere.</p>

<p>Checks and plaids are among the commonest of our
present-day designs, and the Gauls and those of our
forerunners, who flourished at the time of CÃ¦sar,
wore breeches of chequered patterns. In fact, the
very name of breeches is derived from &ldquo;breac,&rdquo;
which means striped or spotted, and in Gaelic also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
signifies the trout, which is speckled. Usually the
ancient breeches showed a number of colours, in
which, according to Diodorus, red predominated.
Queen Boadicea wore a tunic apparently of plaid, the
colours of which had a mixture of blue, red, and
yellow. The real shepherd&rsquo;s plaid of Scotland is of
a plainer character, being merely black and white,
but it is in the special tartans of the Scotch clans that
we find the system of coloured lines and squares
carried to great perfection.</p>

<p>These tartans, as we may judge, date back to times
of which we have no record, but they have been used
continuously in historic times. In the accounts of
King James&nbsp;III of Scotland, in 1471, there are several
entries with regard to money spent on tartans. The
tartans, of course, were a distinguishing mark of the
various Scottish clans, but sometimes, when attempts
have been made to identify the patterns, confusion
has arisen owing to the fact that many clans had
more than one tartan; in fact, there may be the
common clan tartan; that which was worn only by
the chief and his heir; a dress tartan; a fourth for
hunting, and a fifth for mourning. For instance,
while the dress tartan of the MacPhersons consists
chiefly of black and white, with thin lines of red and
yellow, the hunting tartan of the same clan is black
and buff, with lines of blue and red. Similarly, in
the Royal Stuart tartans, we find that the ordinary
Royal Stuart has large red squares, the hunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
tartan is mostly green and blue, while the dress Stuart
has a large amount of white in its composition.
There was, of course, a wonderful variety in colours,
and it is interesting to note that all the dyes required
were obtained from common native plants.</p>

<p>In England, after the Norman Conquest, there
seems to have been little pattern used up to the time
of Henry&nbsp;II, when diaper began to appear. Just as
damask takes its name from Damascus, so diaper
originally was derived from D&rsquo;Ypres, meaning &ldquo;of
Ypres,&rdquo; a town which was noted for rich stuffs and
fine linen. In Edward&nbsp;II&rsquo;s time pied cloth and parti-coloured
silks came into vogue, while costumes of a
parti-coloured character, which developed in the
following reign to such an extent, were seen for the
first time. Sometimes the whole dress would be
symmetrically divided, so that half was of one colour
and half of another. Again, the clothes would be
striped in various directions, or one would find the
right arm and left leg coloured blue, while the other
two limbs were red. We get something of the same
kind of ornamentation nowadays, as already noticed,
in the dress of jockeys and the colours of athletic
clubs.</p>

<p>In studying decorative patterns, the way in which
some natural object has often become conventionalized
is very interesting to trace, and if this is so in the
case of art of civilized people, it is still more true of
savage decoration. Our object is not, however, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
deal with the evolution of ornamentation pure and
simple, though we commend its study to our readers.</p>

<p>Turning to the Jews for a moment, we may recall
that part of the adornment of the High Priests consisted
of pomegranates and bells. The connection
does not seem at all obvious, and Mrs. Finn has
suggested that the bells are probably the flowers of
the pomegranate which have been conventionalized.</p>

IMPRESSIONS TO BE GAINED FROM
DRESS</h2>

<p class="srt1">CLUES FROM CLOTHES&mdash;INDIVIDUALITY NOT DISGUISED BY
THEM&mdash;MODERN DRESS OF OTHER COUNTRIES&mdash;SIGNIFICANCE
OF CLOTHES</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">If</span> we turn our attention once more to clothes and
their effect upon the outsider, there are questions
to consider with regard to what may be judged from
dress. First of all, as to the matter of social status,
it must be confessed that it is very much more difficult
nowadays than it was years ago to make any pronouncements
from clothes, though it must be pointed
out that there is a way of wearing clothes, quite
irrespective of their kind, that will help us considerably
in making a judgment.</p>

<p>The reason for the levelling up or down as the case
may be, is due, of course, to the standard of luxury
having been raised and the price of materials for
clothing having been lowered. As regards the determination
of the profession of the wearer from his
or her dress, it must be said that often we remain
quite at a loss in the matter. Bearing and expression
and general action may again afford a clue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>Characteristic costumes are now rare. We can tell
the cleric as a rule, though some, especially those
who have belonged to some other profession previously,
will not adopt the collarless coat of black, the
choker, or the white tie.</p>

<p>Servants&rsquo; liveries may be left out of consideration
here, but the man that has to do with horses proverbially
looks &ldquo;horsey.&rdquo; To the list of uniforms
to which we are accustomed there has been added of
recent years that of the hospital nurse. The garb of
various sisterhoods still catches our eye, and there
are certain points which may help us occasionally
in identifying a doctor, a lawyer, a schoolmaster,
and an actor. According to a recent article by a
detective in one of the daily papers,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> the characteristics
and individuality of a man will show through his
clothes, and the writer alluded to, suggests the putting
of a clergyman into a soldier&rsquo;s or a sailor&rsquo;s uniform,
or again, the dressing of a valet in his master&rsquo;s clothes.
&ldquo;He will look quite different. He will give a fresh
character to the clothes, and you will realize at once
that he is a second-hand copy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Chevasse says that if you walk down Oxford
Street, Piccadilly, or through the City, you may pick
out the ex-army officer, in his mufti tweed, for his
instinct for dress is so ingrained that it is easy to
recognize him. Mr. Chevasse would tell the fashionable
physician from the following signs. His frock
coat, scrupulously cut, his silk hat correctly quiet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
which fit in with his sleek manners and the sang-froid
of his superior knowledge. The dress dummy is
another type&mdash;the man with the airs of a peacock,
whose every article of dress is meant to attract attention.
Of the actor whom one meets in the Strand, it
is said that the odds and ends which he wears are
typical of the parts he plays, but that his real individual
character is not disguised as sometimes he
might wish it to be.</p>

<p>In similar fashion we are given the points of the
modern solicitor, of whom there are, we are told, two
classes. The first type is dressed to exhale prosperity,
and to convince the litigant that he is a safe man, but
the character of his waistcoat will tell you more often
than not that he robs Peter to pay Paul. The dress
of other solicitors beams out sincerity, truth, reliability;
the cloth is good and plain, and is well fitted
to inspire trust and confidence.</p>

<p>At the present time so many visitors from other
countries, who are sojourning here for a while or
have come to stay, are to be seen in our streets, that
it may be of interest to see what the Editor of the
<cite>Tailor and Cutter</cite><a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> has to say upon the subject
of their dress, or so far as that of the men goes.
He says that, as a rule, in the case of the members
of the aristocracy of all nations, their garments give
the impression of having been made in London, and
are free from the peculiarities which characterize those
of other countries. Generally speaking, however, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
is not difficult to tell the nationality of a man by his
clothes. The American&rsquo;s garments are usually made
two sizes too large for him. The collar of his coat
is very narrow, and the shoulders and back, on the
other hand, exceedingly wide. His jackets are often
extremely long, his trousers are peg-tops, finished
with raised seams.</p>

<p>In some ways the German is a modified American,
though often there is to be found a seam up the front
of his coat from the waist, as he likes plenty of room
about his chest, of which he makes much. While
the American, however, often has his coat finished
in some extraordinary way which he fancies to be
original, there is a lack of personality about the
German, and the uniformity of his garments would
appear to be the result of his military training. The
American likes a lounge suit, and the German the
same, or a morning coat, while the Frenchman
favours the latter or a frock coat, which he has
finished off with as much ornamentation as possible
in the way of silk facings, braided edges, and fantastic
flaps. His garments are close-fitting, and the
waist is emphasized.</p>

<p>The Spaniard is like the Frenchman with modifications,
for his garments are tasteful and neat, with
few peculiarities. In warm weather he wears no
vest, and his jackets are close-fitting and finished
with a low roll. In Austrian and Hungarian clothes
French and German ideas seem to be skilfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
blended, while Italian dress has more of the French
than of the German characters. Norwegians and
Danes are like Englishmen, though there is perhaps
a little more preciseness and stiffness about their
clothes. The colonial has no desire for show, and
his tweed lounge suit is cut for comfort and made up
for strength.</p>

<p>The impressions to be gained from dress that we
have hitherto mentioned in this chapter are chiefly
those which are unintentionally given to us by their
wearers. The significances which it is meant that
clothes should bear are still most numerous and important.</p>

<p>To-day, on ordinary occasions, rank is not shown
by any special dress, which those in high stations
themselves wear, though the case of their servants is
different. In earlier times in our history, especially
under the earlier Tudors, rank was indicated in
civilian dress. Now the frock coat worn by King
and Peer is considered just as necessary in many
businesses, and is characteristic of the shop-walker.
Men of assured position can even afford to dress
badly, though the poor man cannot.</p>

<p>Here and there we have met with survivals of class
costumes (see pages <a href="#Page_150">150</a> and <a href="#Page_308">308</a>), and to these we
may add that of the costermongers, for in the dress
of both men and women there are peculiarities which
single them out.</p>

<p>In the same way we find remnants here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
of special dresses that are characteristic of trades.
The blue blouse of the butcher, the white clothes of
the butterman or man cook, and the white cap of
the latter are cases in point; and in connection with
certain duties and modern manufactures we have
special dresses. We might allude to the overalls of
furriers, feather merchants, and stationers. Divers,
sewage men, and miners have special dresses, and
boiler cleaners have a curious dress of coat and
trousers made in one, which recalls one form of the
military tunic used by the Norman soldiers, which
sometimes ended in closely fitting trousers. It was first
drawn on the legs, and the arms were then put through
the sleeves. Such combination garments are shown
in contemporary drawings, and it has been questioned
whether these were really made in one piece, but the
artist, though he might not indicate with certainty
the openings through which they were put on, is
hardly likely to have left out the lines which would
have made clear a division at the waist.</p>

<p>At the present time in England there are very little
differences in the costume of single and married
women, though it was once compulsory for them to
dress differently. The remains, however, of the
custom are to be found in plenty in foreign countries.</p>

<p>In many professions rank is indicated by the dress
or its ornamentations. In the Army and Navy, the
Church, the legal profession, such points are obvious.
We have had occasion to deal with academical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
costume, and in the knightly orders the same holds
good. Just as an undergraduate has a stuff gown,
while a graduate may have a silk one, a Proctor is
given velvet sleeves and the Chancellor of the University
an embroidered gown and train, so, for
instance, in the order of Knights of the Order of
St. John of Jerusalem, the Knight of Grace has a
stuff gown, the Knight of Justice a silk one, while
the Grand Prior is habited in velvet.</p>

THE EFFECT OF CLOTHES UPON THE
INDIVIDUAL</h2>

<p class="srt1">THE ORIGIN OF STAYS&mdash;TIGHT LACING NO NEW THING&mdash;ITS
EFFECTS&mdash;MR. HEATHER BIGG ON THE NEED FOR
SUPPORT&mdash;THE IDEAL FOOT&mdash;SKULL DEFORMITIES&mdash;PADDING</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">We</span> have already seen (page <a href="#Page_111">111</a>) that the human
form may be directly mutilated in connection
with the wearing of ornaments and in order to produce
scars or tattoo marks which are considered to be
embellishments and often in a way take the place of
clothes, in so much as they do away with the appearance
of nakedness. Now we may consider the distortions
which are actually caused by clothes and
bandages. There are cases for which, as a rule, we
have to look outside the confines of Europe in which
special contrivances are worn for a time in order to
permanently alter the shape of some part of the body.
Then, again, we meet among the races which claim
to be most highly civilized instances which are not
one whit less barbaric, but in which some article of
dress is intended to cause or allowed to produce distortions,
which satisfy the dictates of some particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
fashion. It may be that an appearance of elegance
or smartness is aimed at which may be the natural
attribute of some persons and the envy of others,
or a false idea of symmetry may lead to the same
thing.</p>

<p>The idea of altering bodily conformation is very
ancient, but following our usual plan we will touch,
first of all, on the modern examples of the custom
before tracing the older ones. Not very long ago,
and not for the first time in history, a great many
women became imbued with the notion that there was
nothing more desirable in this world than a wasp-like
waist; and there are rumours, not to say signs, even
in the twentieth century, when it might be supposed
that we were getting more sensible, that a similar
madness is again to overtake the gentler sex.</p>

<p>Now we may discuss the apparatus which has been
degraded into carrying out the painful duty of producing
an attenuated figure. The name stays indicates
exactly the original intention of the clothing to
which it is applied; but unfortunately something
more than mere support has been sought after at
various times since the classic period to which the
beginnings of stays may be traced. The pair of
stays which together form the modern corset&mdash;sometimes
ignorantly and by false analogy supplied with
an extra &ldquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;is what is now used for purposes of
compression. Proximately the idea is that of improving
the figure, as it is called, and ensuring that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
it can be covered with garments of a fashionable
shape. The ultimate results are about as bad as they
can be, and it is not a question of opinion in this case,
for the evil effects can be easily demonstrated. Sir
William Flower<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> refers to the practice as being &ldquo;one
of the most remarkable of all the artificial deformities
produced by adherents to a conventional standard, in
defiance of the dictates of Nature and of reason.&rdquo;
He points out that in the process of deforming the
skull, to which we shall allude later, the latter being
a solid case with tolerably uniform walls, its capacity
remains the same whatever alterations may be made
in the shape, but in the case of the body it is quite
another matter. It can, in fact, be well likened to a
cylinder of fixed length which is closed above and
below by a framework of bone, and circular compression
must actually diminish the area which has to be
occupied by some of the most vital organs. He goes
on to say that the framework of the chest is a most
admirable and complex arrangement of numerous
pieces of solid bone and elastic cartilage joined
together in such a manner as to allow of expansion
and contraction for the purposes of respiration&mdash;expansion
and contraction which, if a function so
essential to the preservation of life and health is to
be performed in an efficient manner, should be perfectly
free and capable of variation under different
circumstances. So, indeed, it has been allowed to be
in all parts of the world and in all ages with one exception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
It was reserved for mediÃ¦val civilized Europe
to have invented the system of squeezing together,
rendering immobile, and actually deforming the most
important part of the human frame; and the custom
has been handed down to, and flourishes in, our day,
notwithstanding all our professed admiration for the
models of classical antiquity, and our awakened attention
to the laws of health.</p>

<p>The crusade against corsets is by no means confined
to this country; even the educational authorities in
America and on the continent of Europe have dealt
pretty drastically with the matter. It is said, moreover,
that the Queen of Portugal has brought before
the ladies of her Court the evils of tight lacing, by
means of radiographs. There have been other times
when even laws have been made with regard to the
corset, which, it appears, was first employed for a
wrong purpose in mediÃ¦val times. It is said of the
time of Henry&nbsp;III of France that the corset was no
longer the simple basquine that was inoffensive enough
at first.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> The corps piquÃ© which was endured by the
fair ladies of the period was an instrument of torture.
A hard solid mould into which the wearer had to be
compressed, there to remain and suffer in spite of the
splinters of wood that penetrated the flesh, took the
skin off the waist, and made the ribs ride one over
the other. Montaigne and Ambrose ParÃ© are witnesses,
and the latter must have known something
about the question. It is not, perhaps, surprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
that Charles&nbsp;IX and Henry&nbsp;III brought in stringent
laws on the subject.</p>

<p>We are told<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> that with Catherine de Medici&rsquo;s ascent
to the throne the habit became compulsory. She gave
her subjects no choice, and said that all women of
good birth and breeding should wear corsets which
would reduce their waists to the abnormal size of
thirteen inches.</p>

<p>In our country on various occasions lacing was
carried to extremes, as in the time of Henry&nbsp;VIII.
In Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, the forerunner of the busks was
not fastened to the stays, but consisted of a piece of
carved wood which was pushed down inside the
bodice. (See Plate <a href="#plate11">XI</a>.) Some of the outer bodices
in the times of the early Georges seem to be as hard
and unyielding as if they were intended for armour.
Tin stays were not unheard of in the days of the
earlier colonists in America.</p>

<p class="plate"><i>PLATE XI.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>The craze for tight lacing once more made itself
felt at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and
not many years before the end one heard from time to
time of the cruelty that was practised at high-class
schools for young ladies, where the girls were made
to sleep in specially tight and rigid corsets.</p>

<p>Although there is a tendency to abolish stays, it
does not, of course, prove that on occasion they may
not be of use. Mr. Heather Bigg, the well-known
surgeon, who is a specialist in cases of spinal curvature,
and who adopts mechanical means of treatment,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
is in a position to offer an opinion on the use of corsets,
as he uses special ones as precautionary means of
support and where curvatures may threaten, as well
as to be safeguards against relapse after the mechanical
treatment of a curvature has been consummated.
In one of his books he has much to offer in favour
of the corset, and at the outset it may be well to say
that Mr. Heather Bigg&rsquo;s remarks are mainly directed
against the views of the practitioner who, from the
treatment that he advises, is called a gymnastic
practitioner, and who, according to Mr. Heather
Bigg, goes further than attacking matters of treatment,
and in order to popularize his own practice
endeavours to entwine with it revolutions that shall
extend even to the simplest garments. For instance,
the gymnastic practitioner maintains that corsets are
detrimental to health.</p>

<p>Mr. Heather Bigg&rsquo;s opinions practically are those
with which most sensible people would entirely agree.
The arguments which he brings forward in favour of
them are not, however, very conclusive, as we hope to
show. Corsets, he says, are intended in their right
and proper use simply to stay and support the body
in its natural shape, and not to mould it into funny
forms according to the vagaries of fashion. The
women of classic times did not use them for this
purpose. On the contrary, they had no reason to do
so, as their flowing garments did not permit them to
display the outlines of their figures; they therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
simply wore corsets because it had been found by
centuries of experience that they were conducive to
health and serviceable in exertion.</p>

<p>His description of the original corset of Greece
and Rome will show to what ancient form of stay the
modern corset may be traced. The arrangements of
the ancients consisted of three pieces, and these were
worn either together or separately, as required. They
consisted of supporting bands worn round the body
in a way very similar to the &ldquo;putties&rdquo; worn for support
round the legs by the present-day soldiery. The
main and most useful portion of the corset was a zone,
or loin band. Then there was the thoracic band, or
strophion, intended to uphold the breasts and conserve
the figure. And, lastly, there was the waistband,
which filled up the space between the other two.
It is from the conjunction of these triple bands that
the modern corset has been evolved, as it is worn by
women of every class throughout civilized Europe
to-day. What was made before in three pieces is now
simply manufactured in one.</p>

<p>Now let us consider the reasons given by Mr.
Heather Bigg as to why &ldquo;women of all dominant
and civilized races always wear, and with advantage
have worn, some binder or corset&rdquo;; and again, why
the whole history of the world shows that extraneous
support is beneficial. In the first place, Mr. Heather
Bigg says that in primitive and aboriginal races that
practically wear no clothes, the girls may be perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
in form when they arrive at their full growth, but
that they are, as a rule, &ldquo;hideous objects of disfigurement
after their first child.&rdquo; The inference is that
civilized women retain their beauty in later life owing
to the fact that they have worn stays. On the other
hand, the fact that the native girls lose their beauty
must, according to the argument, be because they have
not worn stays; but surely this can be compared with
the fading of a flower or its changing colour after fertilization,
and is rather due to the absence of any conditions
or kind of selection which would tend to preserve
the woman&rsquo;s youthfulness. Besides, we need go no
farther than our own country to find cases where
married women gradually lose their beauty, and the
Welsh and Italian women proverbially age rapidly.</p>

<p>The wearing of belts by navvies when they are
doing heavy work is possibly a precautionary measure
against strain, but it does not refer to the race as
a whole, and one would take it that when it is said
that Elijah girt his loins in order to run before the
chariot of Ahab, it simply means that he fastened up
his flowing garments. To the second question as to
history showing that extraneous support is beneficial,
Mr. Heather Bigg says that the answer is simple even
if Darwinian. He may claim that the &ldquo;if&rdquo; saves
him, though unintentionally, for in his argument he
seems to ignore the main principles of evolution. He
says, first of all, that it might just as well be asked
why any clothing whatsoever should be found requisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
by civilized mankind. He claims rightly, and
so far he is in keeping with Darwinism, that man,
according to his obvious mechanism and morphology,
is a creature built on the quadruped pattern. The
word is spelt &ldquo;quadrupled,&rdquo; though presumably this
is a printer&rsquo;s error; but he goes on to say that this
building was done with the intent that his body should
be horizontal instead of vertical. Of course, the
body of the original quadruped was horizontal; but
in the course of evolution such changes were made
as enabled man to occupy an upright position. Mr.
Heather Bigg talks as if it was an intentional act on
the part of man when he says that he &ldquo;managed to
rear himself in a permanently erect position, and as
he has chosen the upright position, so he has to experience
some of the penalties attached to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The state of affairs is this: man became perfectly
well fitted for an upright position, and his internal
organs were arranged quite properly for progress on
two legs instead of four, although Mr. Heather Bigg
claims to the contrary. What may be the case is,
that natural selection no longer acts to keep man as
perfectly constructed as he was, or to improve him,
and some human beings may need support, owing to
weakness or the undue development of their bust, just
as those of us who suffer from short sight and bad
teeth take advantage of eye-glasses and the skill of
the dentist. We think it hardly time yet to say that
all women need stays, any more than that we all need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
eye-glasses or should be provided with false teeth at
a certain age.</p>

<p>Summing up the matter, when human beings take
up work for which their bodies were not specially
evolved, or when they wish to do things which at one
time all human beings could do, but which, through
the cessation of the action of natural selection, they
are not now able to do, then they want help. This
would explain why our soldiers when marching in
South Africa found puttees so useful, as Mr. Heather
Bigg maintains.</p>

<p>The case of dress brought forward by Mr. Heather
Bigg is exactly a case in point. We have seen in the
opening chapters of this book that man has lost his
hairy covering, and, so far as cold climates are concerned,
we must agree with Mr. Heather Bigg that it
has been found by experience that clothing is necessary
for healthful warmth. All the same, we should
like to see some experiments tried to show whether
even now it might not be quite possible to exist in
this climate with little or no artificial covering. We
do not agree at all with the statement that as man
&ldquo;has reared himself from four legs on to two, so he
has found by similar experience that some sort of
bandaged support is required in order to assist an
abdominal mechanism that is inadequate for biped
progression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In order to prove that the gymnastic practitioner is
wrong when he says that corsets are injurious to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
health, Mr. Heather Bigg brings forward the results
of experiments made by Professors Roy and Adami,
which he says scientifically prove stays to be distinctly
beneficial. These experiments were described at the
British Association Meeting in 1888, under the title
of &ldquo;The Physiological Bearing of Waist-belts and
Stays,&rdquo; and the effects of these contrivances were
tried not only upon men, but upon animals. It was
shown that a gentle compression of the abdomen
caused a greater flow of blood to other parts of the
body, and conduced in consequence to an increase of
mental and muscular activity. The experimenters
do not seem to have waited to see whether in the
course of time these effects were or were not obtained
at the expense of the digestive organs, but they concluded
that they had directly explained &ldquo;the beneficial
and extensive use of some form or other of
waist-belt by all nations that had passed beyond the
stage of absolute barbarity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The theory has been advanced that stays are derived
from swaddling clothes, and that the custom has survived
in the case of women alone, for we may neglect
the occasional use of such garments by men in the
past at the present time, for, judging from advertisements
in the papers, their use is not confined to the
fair sex. There seems, however, little evidence in
support of this theory, and inquiry from a lady who
has lived a long time in Palestine has elicited the
information that while swaddling clothes are still in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
use in the Holy Land, stays do not form a part of
native dress.</p>

<p>The other part of the body which nowadays
appears to be deformed to the greatest extent is the
foot. It seems to be considered absolutely necessary,
if one is to appear elegant, for one&rsquo;s toes to be pointed
in such a way that the apex of the angle is in the
middle of the foot instead of on the inner side; and
although the two points are probably unconnected,
we might here mention the idea that in a perfect foot
the second toe ought to be longer than the great
toe. This would make the extreme end of the foot
a little nearer the middle line, and in Art the second
toe is represented as being the longest in accordance
with the Greek canon. These proportions were copied
from the Egyptian representations, and the original
is probably to be found in the negroes, according to
Sir William Flower. The latter points out that the
longer our big toe is, the further we are removed from
apes; and he found, too, that amongst hundreds of bare
and therefore undeformed feet of children in Perthshire,
which he examined, he was not able to find one
in which the second toe was the longest. These
children would, of course, belong to the lower classes,
and it would be interesting to know whether the same
thing holds good in higher social circles when the
foot remains normal. It may be well to remember
that Sir William Flower was a surgeon, for Mr.
Heather Bigg, who tilts with the gymnastic practitioner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
once more on the subject of boots and stockings,
expresses somewhat different ideas upon the question.
He alludes to the two classes of people in the British
Isles who habitually discard boots and stockings&mdash;the
fisher-folk and factory girls in some of the large Scotch
cities. He says that he scarcely likes to be ungallant
about the latter, but commends the adult feet of both
of these classes to the inspection of those who would
draft their children into the &ldquo;bare-footed brigade.&rdquo;
He continues as follows: The truth is that the feet
of those who have been unbooted till they have
reached adult life are splayed and spread, large-jointed,
and very generally deformed from all approach
to the ideal foot as it is depicted by the greatest
painters, or modelled by the greatest sculptors.</p>

<p>We have seen that the ideal foot of the sculptors
is probably not a true ideal from an evolutionary
point of view, and there is no doubt but that the ideal
foot would be the one produced under natural conditions
in which we cannot include boots and stockings.
We should take it, however, that the stones of the
seashore and the floor of a factory are not the ideal
surfaces on which to habitually tread.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that the deformities caused
by shoes are often very great, and Sir William Flower
sums up the matter in the following sentences:&mdash;&ldquo;The
English mother or nurse who thrusts the tender
feet of a young child into stiff, unyielding, pointed
shoes or boots, often regardless of the essential difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
in form of right and left at a time when freedom
is especially needed for their proper growth and
development, is the exact counterpart of the Chinook
Indian woman, applying her bandages and boards to
the opposite end of her baby&rsquo;s body, only with considerably
less excuse; for a distorted head apparently
less affects health and comfort than cramped and misshapen
feet, and was also esteemed of more vital
importance to preferment in Chinook society. Any
one who recollects the boots of the late Lord
Palmerston will be reminded that a wide expanse
of shoe leather is in this country, even during the
prevalence of an opposite fashion, quite compatible
with the attainment of the highest political and social
eminence.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>After all, it is generally what our eyes are accustomed
to that we consider to be right and fitting.
The broad-toed shoes that were adopted in the reign
of Henry&nbsp;VIII look clumsy to us; but so did the
pneumatic tyres of bicycles after we had got used to
the look of the narrow solid ones. It is not so much
the wearing of boots of course, but the kind of boots
that has to be considered.</p>

<p>The high heels of shoes add to the evil effects of
the pointed toes, and a copy of a drawing from an
advertisement figured by Sir William Flower recalls
strongly the stunted foot of a Chinese woman which
the wearer of the shoe would be one of the first
probably to anathematize. This brings us to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
malformation which has been caused through many
centuries in a country that can claim a good deal of
civilization, and is produced by special bandages
after a long and very painful course of treatment.</p>

<p>There is very little evidence of alteration in the
form of the head having been practised in this country,
though one or two skulls have been found, and there
is a tradition that the custom prevailed not very long
ago in Norfolk. In France, however, it was well
known until recent years, and even it may not have
now become extinct. There are plenty of records in
the works of early writers with regard to the practice,
and some of the North-American Indians still follow
the fashion of their fathers. The Chinook Indians
flatten the skull between boards so that they get the
name of Flat-heads, and other tribes produce an
elongated skull by constructing bandages of deer
hide. Deformation of the head seems to have little
effect on the free-living American Indians, but the
same statement does not hold good among Europeans.
According to the reports of French physicians, they
have traced all kinds of troubles to the practice.</p>

<p>If we have little evidence of head-deforming in this
country by means of compression, we meet occasionally
with prehistoric skulls which have been trepanned,
and have had inserted into them a small piece
of extraneous bone. It is curious that such an operation
could have been successfully made when there
were probably no instruments of metal with which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
could be done, and one might well ask what object
could possibly have been in view, especially as the
individual so treated had met with no accident that
could have rendered the operation necessary. It
appears, however, that the piece of bone was probably
that of some dead relative, the idea being that the
incorporation of it in the head of the young man
would give him the qualities of the chief who had
departed. It is this notion which probably led to
cannibalism. When a brave warrior was slain, his
conqueror thought that by eating a small piece of him
he might add his adversary&rsquo;s prowess to his own, and no
doubt when a respected relative died it was thought
that his good qualities would pass to those who ate
a portion of him.</p>

<p>Besides the alterations that have been permanently
made in the shape of the body, there are many curious
instances where clothes themselves have been utilized
for the purpose of apparently altering its shape. We
have seen that Punch&rsquo;s curious figure is due to a
costume, while the stuffed breeches adopted in the
reign of James&nbsp;I, the great farthingale of Elizabeth&rsquo;s
reign, the hooped petticoat of Queen Anne&rsquo;s, and the
crinoline of the nineteenth century are instances of
fashions that originated with or without apparent
reasons.</p>

<p>Just as Mrs. Aria discovered what she terms the
ancestress of the straight-fronted specialitÃ© corset
on a bas-relief of a female figure from one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
mysterious forest cities in South America, so Mr.
Rhead has reminded us of the festal dress of Otaheite
which Captain Cook figured in his &ldquo;Geography.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our grandmothers in their crinoline may have
looked like walking hay-cocks; but the young
women of Otaheite who carry presents from one
person of rank to another look as if they were issuing
from an immense drum. It is nothing new to make
up deficiencies with padding that is intended to deceive,
and while at one time our countrywomen may
have made themselves flat-chested with the help of
leaden weights, some, judging from articles which we
now see displayed in the shops, are willing to call to
their aid artificial contrivances which give the appearance
of plumpness to their bust.</p>

<p>When speaking of padding, one might recall the
fact that the most usual place in which it is to be
found&mdash;in civilians&rsquo; clothes at least&mdash;is on the shoulder.
This reminds us of the way in which sleeves were
sometimes puffed up above the shoulder. The protuberance
thus formed, Dr. Meyer tells us, was
originally intended to prevent weapons from slipping
off when they were carried over the shoulder. The
fashion has since, however, been adopted in civilian
costume both by men and by women.</p>

FURTHER EFFECTS OF CLOTHES
ON THE INDIVIDUAL</h2>

<p class="srt1">MENTAL EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT CLOTHES&mdash;PREFERENCES OF
GIRLS FOR CERTAIN ARTICLES OF DRESS&mdash;MOVEMENTS
THAT DEPEND UPON THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF
CLOTHES</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Putting</span> on one side the special points of detriment
which clothes bring about with regard to
the body, we may turn to more general effects. Our
language is full of proverbial sayings as to the way
in which clothes may give beauty, and also as to how
much we owe to fine feathers and to our tailors.
Quite apart from the results which clothes have upon
other people, there are the mental effects which are
produced on ourselves. That it is not, perhaps, comfort
or discomfort altogether which causes our body
to react on the mind, is shown by the results of some
investigations made by Dr. Louis W. Flaccus among
the schoolgirls of New York.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>Feelings of lightheartedness are the result of
filmy clothes, and one girl of eighteen said that
whenever she had on a garment of this consistency
she always wanted to dance. The pleasant mental
effects of gauzy stuffs and laces are said by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
investigator to be due not only to their lightness, but
to the mental associations with which they are connected.
Such dresses as those which we have mentioned
suggest some gay social function. Again,
just as the putting on of a smoking jacket suggests
relaxation to a man, so does the assuming of evening
dress impart the idea that correct behaviour is necessary.
Heavy clothes bring about mental depression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a large, heavy hat my spirits are low,&rdquo; says
one of the girls who were interrogated, and Dr.
Flaccus claims that the mood may change with the
hat, while that he has evidence to go upon will be seen
from the following answers: &ldquo;A broad hat makes me
feel jolly&rdquo;; &ldquo;If my hat is flat on my forehead, I feel
depressed&rdquo;; &ldquo;If I have a fancy hat on, I am in a
coquettish mood&rdquo;; or again, &ldquo;I feel brighter in a
hat that rolls away from my face.&rdquo; Then the effect
which certain surfaces have upon various persons has
to be taken into consideration when dealing with this
aspect of the subject, for clothes are made of very
different materials. To touch a blanket will set some
individuals&rsquo; teeth on edge, and an irritable mood may
result when rough material rubs against the skin.
Again, while one person feels chills running down her
back when she touches velvet, another will delight to
feel a velvety surface. Another remarkable thing
which Dr. Flaccus has brought before us is the
striking difference between the preferences which
girls have for certain articles of clothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the girls to whom the questions were
addressed put shoes first; gloves came very close,
then neckwear, hats, underwear, jewellery, and
ribbons; and though this may not fit in with the
ideas of the humorists on the subject, the weakness
for hats was shown to be less than one-third that for
gloves.</p>

<p>Speaking of the effect that clothes may have upon
the action of people, we may recall the way in which
skirts and trousers may give rise to different habits.
If one drops anything into a boy&rsquo;s lap he instinctively
brings his knees together to prevent the object
thrown from falling between them; whereas a girl
would throw her thighs apart in order to make a
receptacle with her frock. Advantage has been
taken of this fact by those who wished to discover
whether a person with whom they were dealing was a
woman, or a man masquerading in female attire.</p>

<p>More than one novelist has enlarged on this theme,
and Mark Twain has used it effectively in the &ldquo;Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn.&rdquo; The occasion is
when the hero visits Mrs. Judith Loftus at St. Petersburg,
in order to find out what is going on with
regard to the murder. Mrs. Loftus, whose suspicions
were aroused, got the boy who was dressed
up as a girl, to thread a needle, to throw a bit of lead
at a rat, and having gained some evidence from these
two experiments, she tried a third.</p>

<p>She says, &ldquo;Keep your eye on the rats; you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
better have the lead in your lap handy.&rdquo; Huckleberry&rsquo;s
story continues: &ldquo;So she dropped the lump
into my lap just at that moment. I clapped my legs
together on it, and she went on talking, but only
about a minute. Then she took off the hank (he was
holding some yarn), and looked me straight in the
face, but very pleasant, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, now&mdash;what&rsquo;s your real name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wh-what, mum?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or
Bob, or what is it?&rdquo;</p>

THE RISE AND FALL OF FASHIONS</h2>

<p class="srt1">REASONS WHY FASHIONS ARE FOLLOWED&mdash;GAY CLOTHES
SEEN WHEN PERIODS OF DEPRESSION ARE OVER&mdash;CONDEMNATION
OF FASHIONS BY THE CLERGY&mdash;QUAKERS&mdash;SUMPTUARY
LAWS&mdash;THE KILLING OF FASHIONS</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> rise and fall of fashions is a matter that
affects every nation and practically every individual,
for savages are quite as much harassed and
tortured by them as any civilized people are. Fashions
are perpetuated, as Herbert Spencer has pointed out,
by imitation, and from two motives which are widely
divergent. It may be prompted by reverence for the
one imitated, on the one hand, or by a desire to assert
equality with him. In the beginning, no doubt
fashions arose with an idea to improve upon nature,
though notions as to ideals of beauty must have been
hazy in many cases.</p>

<p>Fashions have been advanced as evidence in support
of the proverb that there is nothing new under
the sun, and the way in which some of them come
round again goes a very long way to prove it in the
case of clothes. Luckily some enormities seem to
have died out, but in the light of past history we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
never feel quite safe, and we never know, on the other
hand, where some slight change which in itself seems
novel may not lead us to ridiculous extremes. Of
course, many garments and styles are importations
from other countries. The pelisse came from Persia
at the time of the Crusaders, just as the kimono was
brought in recent times from Japan. Fads and peculiarities
and even deformities of Royalty, as we saw in
the case of the peruke, have introduced fashions. The
crinoline, according to all accounts, was first devised
to hide the shape of a princess. Perhaps no other
contrivance has brought more nuisance in its train or
had more ridicule poured upon it; but it is only one
instance of many fashions that have been carried to
excess. It is true, as we shall have occasion to mention,
that in earlier times laws were enacted to restrict
the size of ruffs and the length of the toes of shoes,
but often with little effect, and when shape and size
did not occupy attention, the costliness of the garment
caused restrictions to be made, while the clergy seem
never to have ceased from inveighing against the follies
of fashions.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century the devil was represented by
an old illustrator in the costume of a fine lady with
the long hanging sleeves and tightly laced bodice of
the time. A hundred years later English preachers
took exception to laced openings through which
ladies showed their costly under-linen, and dignified
them with the name of &ldquo;gates of hell.&rdquo; In the twentieth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
century ministers in the United States have
wasted their time in scolding the lady members of
their congregations for wearing fancy stockings.
Sometimes, on the other hand, the clergy themselves
have laid themselves open to criticism with regard to
the gorgeousness of their apparel.</p>

fashions of the gayest. We may recall the times of
Charles&nbsp;II, when England breathed again after the
civil wars. After the French Revolution, when the
reign of terror was over, the Merveilleuses went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
back to the dresses of antiquity, such as the Athenian
costume and that of the Lacedemonian girls, whose
tunics were slit down the sides from the hips. When
this was not done the skirts were looped up on the left
side above the knee with a cameo brooch. (See Figure
<a href="#fig168">168</a>.) One writer records a wager in which a lady
betted that her dress, including trinkets, did not weigh
two pounds. She afterwards retired and took off the
dress, which was weighed, and the whole costume
turned the scales at a little over a pound. One of these
dresses went by the name of the &ldquo;female savage,&rdquo;
and consisted of a gauze chemise over pink fleshings,
with golden garters. It is not surprising that such
costumes, like others before, brought down upon them
the condemnation of the Church, and the following
&ldquo;bull,&rdquo; dated at Rome on the 16th October, 1800, is
reprinted from <cite>The Times</cite> of January 28th, 1801:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Pope, so long engaged in reducing the
Gallican Church within the Catholic pale, has not
been negligent of the duty of recalling the female
form within the petticoat and the handkerchief. After
speaking in appropriate terms of the present scarcity
of clothing, and of the sensations it may excite even
in the withered bosom of a monk, and quoting the
authority of St. Clement of Alexandria, His Holiness
strictly enjoins his officers, civil and ecclesiastical, to
repress, by fine or corporal punishment, according to
the circumstances of the case, these crying enormities.
He directs, too, that their punishment should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
extended to such damsels as though at first sight they
appear properly attired, are nevertheless decked in
transparent robes, and with a voluptuous and magnificent
attire display themselves in very seductive and
tempting attitudes. Moreover, fathers, husbands,
heads of families, who weakly or negligently permit
their wives, daughters, servants, etc., to trespass
against these rules, shall not escape with impunity.
Also, all taylors, haberdashers, milliners and men-milliners,
hairdressers, and others who contribute to these
enormities of dress shall in no wise pass unpunished.&rdquo;
The bull goes on to state that &ldquo;all priests, confessors,
overseers, churchwardens, and others shall in no wise
admit such delinquents to the Holy Supper; that they
shall not allow women improperly dressed to enter the
church, and if they come they shall be driven out, and
if they resist, the higher powers shall be required to
lend their aid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is said that a Russian nobleman who was used to
judge the position of ladies by the amount of furs
and clothes that they wore, on seeing an English lady
in a costume of the merveilleuse style offered her
money in the belief that she was a beggar.</p>

<p>Fashions may have a special significance, as in the
case of bell-bottom trousers of the costermonger,
for it is said that by the cut of these garments the
progress of the wearer&rsquo;s courtship can be traced.
When he first &ldquo;walks out,&rdquo; the bottoms of his trousers
are of such an ample size that only the toes of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
boots can be seen. As matters proceed and the wedding
comes into view, the trousers assume more
moderate dimensions below the knee, and when at
last the man is married he is content with a bell of
quite modest proportions, with what a writer in one of
our comic papers describes as an almost total absence
of &ldquo;sauciness&rdquo; in the cut of the garment.</p>

<p>The lengths to which women will go in their desire
to appear in the fashion, even if they are not, is shown
by the business which a lady in New York is said to
have founded. According to all accounts, she deals
in nothing but discarded Paris waistbands&mdash;that is to
say, those which bear the names of well-known dressmakers.
Women in plenty in New York will buy
these little strips of silk in order to have them stitched
into their own dresses, to give their friends the impression
that their garments were made in the French
capital.</p>

<p>Laws intended for the good of trade have brought
in fashions, as in the case of the statute cap. The
very objections made by religious sects such as the
Puritans and Quakers, who have departed from
extravagance and superfluity, have given rise to new
fashions of plainness. Even Quaker ladies must have
shown their love of dress, for at a meeting in 1726 the
following message was sent by some of the stronger-minded
of them to their fellow-women:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As first, that immodest fashion of hooped petticoats
or the imitation, either by something put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
their petticoats to make them set full, or any other
imitation whatever, which we take to be but a branch
springing from the same corrupt root of pride. And
also that none of our ffriends accustom themselves to
wear their gowns with superfluous folds behind, but
plain and decent, nor go without aprons, nor to wear
superfluous gathers or plaits in their caps or pinners,
nor to wear their heads drest high behind; neither to
cut or lay their hair on their foreheads or temples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that ffriends be careful to avoid wearing
striped shoes or red and white heeled shoes or clogs
or shoes trimmed with gaudy colours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And also that no ffriends use that irreverent practice
of taking snuff or handing a snuff-box one to the
other in meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Also that ffriends avoid the unnecessary use of
fans in meeting, lest it direct the mind from the more
inward and spiritual exercises which all ought to be
concerned in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And also that ffriends do not accustom themselves
to go with bare breasts or bare necks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps in a minor way superstitions also have
tended to keep up fashions. At a wedding, for
instance, it is always said that a bride should wear</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Something old and something new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something borrowed and something blue.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The enactments, however, which were directed
against excess in dress do not seem to have always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
been so successful. The part which the law has
played with regard to dress in our own country has
been very considerable, and it may be of interest to
consider briefly one or two of the so-called sumptuary
laws.</p>

<p>In Edward&nbsp;III&rsquo;s reign the people were ordered to
dress according to their station, and those who were
not of high rank were forbidden to use expensive furs
and ornaments. These orders were so neglected that
Henry&nbsp;IV revised and strengthened them. Slashed
sleeves at the time of Edward&nbsp;IV were prohibited to
yeomen and any one below their rank. Legislation
was also introduced to lessen the preposterous length
to which the toes of shoes had grown, for it was
enacted that not even the gentlemen should have
them of a greater length than two inches.</p>

<p>The Recorder of Chester shows the following order
made by Henry&nbsp;VIII: &ldquo;To distinguish the head-dresses
of married women from unmarried, no
married woman to wear white or other coloured caps;
and no woman to wear any hat, unless she rides or
goes abroad into the country (except sick or aged
persons), on pain of 3s. 4d.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another law amounted to a tax on persons who
dressed elegantly, for those who would not keep a
horse and armour ready for the wars were fined
heavily if they or their wives wore fine clothes or
ornaments. It is probable, too, that Henry&nbsp;VIII&rsquo;s
officers took care to collect the fines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary brought in a law against the use of silk, and
a little later on the great ruffs claimed attention, for
in 1562 it was ordered that no more than a yard and a
half of kersey should be used in making a ruff.
James&nbsp;I repealed all the sumptuary laws, though we
have seen that he and his successors occupied themselves
somewhat with the dress of the clergy.</p>

<p>In Scotland, after the rising of 1745, an Act was
passed forbidding the wearing of tartan as part of
Highland dress, under the penalty of six months&rsquo;
imprisonment for the first offence and transportation
beyond the seas for seven years for the second. No
Highlander could receive the benefit of the Act of
Indemnity without first taking the following oath:
&ldquo;I, A.B., do swear, and as I shall answer to God at
the great day of judgement, I have not, nor shall
have, in my possession any gun, sword, pistol, or
arm whatsoever, and never use tartan, plaid, or any
part of the Highland garb; and if I do so, may I be
cursed in my undertakings, family, and property,&mdash;may
I never see my wife and children, father, mother,
or relations,&mdash;may I be killed in battle as a coward,
and lie without Christian burial, in a strange land, far
from the graves of my forefathers and kindred; may
all this come across me if I break my oath.&rdquo; This
severe and harsh Act caused great discontent, and
was repealed in 1772.</p>

<p>As showing the hindrances caused to trade by some
of the peculiar regulations, we find that in 1565 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Recorder of London describes an interview which he
had with civic tailors, who were puzzled as to whether
they should &ldquo;line a slop hose, not cut in panes, with
a lining of cotton stitched to the slop over and
besydes the linen lining straight to the leg.&rdquo; The
Recorder, on considering the words of the proclamation
which had caused the trouble, gave it as his
opinion that they could not; but the tailors, though
they went away satisfied, came back to say that their
customers had gone to other tailors outside the City,
who made their clothes for them in the way that was
first suggested. It was this contretemps which caused
the Recorder to write to a higher legal authority.</p>

<p>Nowadays clothes and the law have little to do with
one another, though occasionally ladies&rsquo; dresses about
which there is a dispute are seriously tried on in
court, the legal luminaries meanwhile making a studied
pretence of ignorance with regard to the garments.
Though there are no statutes to curb modern
fashions, yet we are reminded of the rules that have
had to be made in certain theatres on account of the
overwhelming size of the matinÃ©e hat.</p>

<p>Although the law does not seem to have been able
to change the fashions to a very great extent, they
have sometimes been killed suddenly. In the days of
public executions, criminals sometimes elected to wear
fashionable garments, and in consequence the demand
for them ceased. Sometimes, again, those who were
interested in the suppression of the fashion persuaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the doomed man or woman to wear a particular dress,
and a judge has been known to compass the same
end by ordering the hangman who officiated to deck
himself in the objectionable garment.</p>

<p>The wearing of nightgowns in the street by ladies
was stopped owing to a woman being executed in her
bedgown. The use of yellow starch had its death-blow
when the hangman appeared in orange collar
and cuffs. Black satin dresses went out of fashion
because Mrs. Manning was hung when wearing one.
Now, however, as there are no public executions,
there is not this opportunity of getting rid of obnoxious
styles, and society ought to look about for
another means to repress them.</p>

DRESS REFORM</h2>

<p class="srt2">CLOTHES TO BE AVOIDED&mdash;NEED FOR WARMER GARMENTS&mdash;&ldquo;RATIONAL&rdquo;
DRESS FOR WOMEN</p>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> is evident from what we have said about the effect
of clothes upon the body, that there is ample opportunity
for improvement in our costume as regards
its shape and the methods in which it is worn. We
have already said also, when speaking of colour,
that, in the case of men at any rate, it might often
be more picturesque and brighter. There are several
societies whose aim it is to bring about improvements.
The Rational Dress League has general objects in
view, and it also keeps in mind the special one of
introducing bifurcated garments for women. There
is also the Healthy and Artistic Dress Union which
seems to have general objects.</p>

<p>Education is needed in order that knowledge of the
evil results of wrongly shaped shoes and tight stays
may be known, and what is more, such training as
will enable that strength of mind to be acquired
which will prevent the coming generation from being
swayed by foolish fashions. The origin of these it is
difficult to trace, but the pioneers of them, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
self-centred costumiers or willing victims, ought to be
punished in some way. There are points to be borne
in mind in connection with garments which have not
yet been considered, and they cause otherwise unoffending
clothes to do harm. There is no doubt but
that the weight of one&rsquo;s dress should be suspended
from the shoulders, though the great majority of
women hang much of their clothes from their waists.
A good deal of the weight could easily be taken off
this part of the body by the fastening of skirts and
under garments to bodices, or by the use of shoulder-straps
and the introduction of tunics.</p>

<p>Dr. Cantlie<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> has very graphically shown the common
features of a modern family, and he has given a
picture (see Figure <a href="#fig169">169</a>) of a group consisting of the
average-sized mother, the taller and larger-framed
daughter, and the insufficiently clad boy of poor
physique. This author says that the sailor suit worn
at the age of two and a half or three years is a recent
innovation, and the rather puny young boy of to-day
came in with the change. Dr. Cantlie has estimated
that, except in very hot weather, children should have
a pound of clothing for every stone they weigh, for
the one great secret of rendering children healthy
is to keep them warm. As a matter of fact, a girl
that weighs three stone really wears clothes that
weigh three pounds; but one of the small boys of
the same weight, in a sailor suit, wears clothes that
only weigh about half as much as his sister&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Cantlie also objects to short jackets which do
not cover the loins, and says that the public school
that will introduce the Norfolk jacket in the place of
the Eton will thrive at the expense of its neighbours.</p>

<p>High collars worn by youths keep the head at the
wrong angle, and also perpetuate the deformity of
the jaw which is caused by breathing through the
mouth. They also prevent the shoulders from being
squared in the attempt to get rid of round shoulders.
Dr. Cantlie urges a return to the brace worn by our
fathers, and still occasionally seen, in which the
straps are not united. It is impossible for any one
wearing joined braces to stand erect with the
shoulders squared, for they press on the neck and
cause the wearer to poke his head forward.
Dr. Cantlie, however, hopes that the difficulties in
the way of obtaining separate braces will not lead
to the adoption of the elastic belt, for the only place
where this could be worn without bad effects is below
the haunch bones, and in ordinary dress this would
bring it below the waistcoat. It will be found also
that the use of belts by labourers brings evils in its
train which were not mentioned by Mr. Heather Bigg,
when speaking of the advantages of girding up the
loins. (See page <a href="#Page_329">329</a>.)</p>

<p>No account of dress and its developments would
be complete without a reference to Mrs. Bloomer and
the garments which now bear her name, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
emblematical of rational costume. That women have
no absolute claim to petticoats as their own special
dress has been made quite clear, and it is equally
evident that in many places they wear trousers as a
matter of course. Still, in this country there seems
to be a rooted objection on the part of the majority
to doffing skirts, though this seems, however, to be
growing less day by day, in spite of the many reasons
which cause the fair sex to cling to petticoats. As
we have found before, garments which fall to the
ground give dignity, and women sacrifice their dignity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
with difficulty. Yet, as need hardly be pointed out,
men do not wear dressing-gowns when they are
jumping, nor fur-trimmed mantles when they go to
business. Dresses with trains could be kept for
ceremonial occasions, or when there is nothing much
to be done, or again, we might add, when there is
little dust to be raised.</p>

Audrey Watson in &ldquo;Physical Efficiency,&rdquo; by Dr. Cantlie, by kind
permission of Messrs. Putnam&rsquo;s Sons).</p>
</div></div>

<p>Bacteriology has shown us that the long skirt
disseminates germs as it trails along the ground; in
fact, it stirs them up for other people to breathe, and
the culprit herself carries off as her fair share a
large quantity which settles on her dress. In this
way the germs of disease are carried home to the
dwelling-house.</p>

<p>In these days also, when women even jump on
and off motor omnibuses before they are at a stand-still,
it is evident that long frocks are objectionable
and dangerous.</p>

<p>When lady gardeners were first employed at Kew
Gardens, it was found that their skirts got in the way,
and were liable to damage the plants. The Director
ordered that the girls should wear a suitable costume,
and they adopted divided garments, though it must
be said that they covered them to some extent with
an apron. In riding-dress of course ladies wear
trousers under their habits when they use a side
saddle, although it has been considered right of
recent years for them to ride astride, and from time
to time we hear that it is being done. In the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
Stephen and of Edward&nbsp;III women rode astride, and
the ladies in Mexico and other parts of America
regularly do so at the present time.</p>

<p>Chaucer described &ldquo;The Wife of Bath&rdquo; as wearing
&ldquo;on her feet a paire of spurries sharpe.&rdquo; From this
we may judge that she also adopted a cross saddle,
and as a matter of fact in the Elesmere MSS. we
find a picture of her, showing that she rode astride,
and was dressed in a curious garment like a divided
bag. On the Continent, ladies who go shooting very
often dress like their husbands, and a year or two
ago the American newspapers were full of accounts
of a lady who imitated the riding costume of a
hunting man to the smallest detail. Apropos of this,
<cite>The Field</cite><a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> told an amusing story of an English lady
who in a measure unintentionally forestalled our
American cousins, for after she had had the best part
of her habit carried away by some aggressive brambles,
she was seen scudding after her horse in a pair
of real top boots.</p>

<p>Divided garments only appear unfeminine because
we are unaccustomed to see them on ladies, and it
is no secret that they are worn to a very great extent
under skirts. Doubtless there may be some to whom
the very idea of such a thing is abhorrent, and possibly
there are still wardrobes like those of a good
lady mentioned by Miss Alice Morse Earle<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> in her
book on the &ldquo;Costume of Colonial Times.&rdquo; She
was the wife of a respectable and well-to-do Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
settler in the New Netherlands, and her name was
Vrouentje Ides Stoffelsen, and she left behind her in
1641, &ldquo;a gold hoop ring, a silver medal and chain,
and a silver undergirdle to hang keys on; a damask
furred jacket, two black camlet jackets, two doublets,
one iron gray, the other black; a blue, a steel-gray
lined petticoat, and a black coarse camlet-lined petticoat;
two black skirts, a new bodice, two white
waistcoats, one of Harlem stuff; a little black vest
with two sleeves, a pair of damask sleeves, a reddish
mourning gown, not linen; four pair pattens, one of
Spanish leather; a purple apron and four blue aprons,
nineteen cambric caps and four linen ones; a fur cap
trimmed with beaver; nine linen handkerchiefs trimmed
with lace, two pair of old stockings, and three
shifts. One disposed to be critical might note the
somewhat scanty proportion of underclothing in
this wardrobe, and as Ides&rsquo;s husband swore &lsquo;by
his manly troth&rsquo; that the list of her possessions
was a true and complete one, we are forced to believe
that it was indeed all the underclothing she
possessed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems, however, as we have said before, that the
actual ugliness of many of the so-called bloomer
costumes which were in vogue a few years ago, did
much to keep back progress in the direction of their
adoption. It seems as if women were frightened, as
it were, to go the whole hog, and instead of wearing
neat knickerbockers they had them exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
baggy and inelegant, or adopted a kind of hybrid
costume, half bloomers and half skirt.</p>

<p>Let us see what the tendency now is with regard to
a rational dress for women. Mrs. Bloomer had a
skirt just below the knees, and trousers gathered in
at the ankles. The modern bloomers come only to
the knee, but really, as Dr. Bernard O&rsquo;Connor
says when writing in the Gazette published by the
Rational Dress League,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> &ldquo;they are made too full.&rdquo;
Dr. O&rsquo;Connor recommends for active exercise, such as
cycling, something like a sailor&rsquo;s jacket and sailor&rsquo;s
trousers, but the latter should end and be gathered in
at the knees. In addition there should be long tight
stockings, and Dr. O&rsquo;Connor adds that tights
throughout would be preferable to the ordinary
bloomers.</p>

<p>It would seem, however, that this dress for general
use might be improved as regards both form and
elegance, and that a long coat or tunic, reaching
nearly to the knees, with fairly tight knickerbockers,
is the rational dress that is most to be commended
for women.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">By</span> way of ending, we would again point out that
the account which we have given of survivals in
dress and their history, shows that they in their
development are governed by the same laws as those
which act on the bodies and organs of living creatures,

may be taken as a small contribution to &ldquo;the

<p id="tn">Transcriber&rsquo;s note</p>


<p>Anchors for footnote 33 and 34 were added, after careful consideration
where they should have been.</p>

<p>Some illustrations were slightly moved for reader convenience, but
the bold numbers in the index, leading to the original pages, were not
changed.</p>

<p>In the Index, errors in the alphabetical order were not corrected. Also
in the Index, the item &ldquo;Moseley&rdquo; seemed to contain a footnote,
which has been removed because it did not refer to anything. The original said:
&ldquo;see Plate X, fig. C<sup>1</sup>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A few punctuation errors have been corrected silently. Also the
following corrections were made, on page<br />

134 &ldquo;Fusillers&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;Fusiliers&rdquo; (Fig. 109)<br />

145 &ldquo;Sketon&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;Skeleton&rdquo; (Dutch Skeleton Dress)<br />

213 &ldquo;carboard&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;cardboard&rdquo; (made of cardboard covered with
cloth)<br />

221 &ldquo;almostly&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;almost&rdquo; (agree almost entirely with those)<br />

263 &ldquo;mop&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;mob&rdquo; (Fig 154.), also in the List of Illustrations<br />

278 &ldquo;Markan&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;Marken&rdquo; (the women of Marken, in Holland, may
have)<br />

289 &ldquo;o&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;0&rdquo; (8s. 0d.)<br />

309 &ldquo;deferentiate&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;differentiate&rdquo; (serve to differentiate
the sisters)<br />

314 &ldquo;promegranate&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;pomegranate&rdquo; (the flowers of the
pomegranate)<br />

329 &ldquo;had&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;hand&rdquo; (On the other hand, the fact that)<br />

369 &ldquo;Abesses&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;Abbesses&rdquo; (Abbesses, costume of)<br />

388 &ldquo;oy&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;by&rdquo; (worn by Punch).</p>

<p>Otherwise the original has been preserved, including inconsistent
spelling and hyphenation.</p>
